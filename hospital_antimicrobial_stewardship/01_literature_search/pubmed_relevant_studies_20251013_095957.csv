37700179,The impact of a non-restrictive Antimicrobial Stewardship Program in the emergency department of a secondary-level Italian hospital.,"Evidence supporting the effectiveness of Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) Programs in the emergency department (ED) setting is limited. We conducted a prospective cohort study to assess the efficacy of an AMS program in an ED and a short-stay observation unit. The intervention included periodic prospective audits (twice a week), conducted by four infectious disease consultants. Primary outcomes included the difference in the hospital mortality rate, antibiotic consumption, and the incidence of bloodstream infections (BSI) caused by multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria, before March 2020-February 2021 and after March 2021-February 2022 when the program was implemented. Interrupted time-series analysis was performed to assess the effect of our program. During the 12-month program, we performed 152 audits and evaluated 366 antibiotic therapies out of a total of 853 patients admitted. In the intervention period, we observed a non-statistically significant decrease in total antibiotic consumption, with a change in level of - 31.2 defined daily dose/100 patient-days (PD) (p = 0.71). Likewise, we found no significant variations in the rate of BSI due to MDR Gram-positive (CT - 0.02 events/PD, p = 0.84), MDR Gram-negative bacteria (CT 0.08, p = 0.71), or Candida spp. (CT 0.008, p = 0.86). Conversely, we found a significant decrease in the mortality rate between the pre- and post-intervention periods (- 1.98 deaths/100 PD, CI - 3.9 to - 0.007, p = 0.049). The Antibiotic Stewardship Program in the ED was associated with a significant decrease in the mortality rate. More high-quality studies are needed to determine the most effective ASP strategies in this unique setting.",Internal and emergency medicine,2024,Caterina Monari; Lorenzo Onorato; Enrico Allegorico; Valentina Minerva; Margherita Macera; Giorgio Bosso; Federica Calò; Antonio Pagano; Teresa Russo; Gennaro Sansone; Marina D'Isanto; Antonio Casciotta; Monica Vanni; Fabio Giuliano Numis; Nicola Coppola,"['Humans', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Prospective Studies', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Hospitals', 'Emergency Service, Hospital', 'Italy']","['Antimicrobial stewardship', 'Audit', 'DDI', 'Emergency department', 'MDR']",7
35905080,Prospective audit and feedback implementation by a multidisciplinary antimicrobial stewardship team shortens the time to de-escalation of anti-MRSA agents.,"Prospective audit and feedback (PAF) is considered an effective procedure for appropriate antibiotic use. However, its effect on the time to de-escalation is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the effect of daily PAF implementation, focusing on the time to de-escalation of anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) agents as an outcome measure. To this end, a single-center, retrospective, quasi-experimental study including patients treated with intravenous anti-MRSA agents during pre-PAF (April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015) and post-PAF (April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016) periods was conducted. The time to de-escalation was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed to assess the effect of daily PAF implementation on the time to de-escalation. Interrupted time series analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between daily PAF implementation and anti-MRSA agent utilization data converted to defined daily dose (DDD) and days of therapy (DOT) per 1,000 patient days. The median time to de-escalation was significantly shorter in the post-PAF period than in the pre-PAF period (6 days vs. 7 days, P < 0.001). According to multivariate analysis, PAF implementation was independently associated with a shorter time to de-escalation (hazard ratio [HR], 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.35). There were no significant differences in hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, and length of stay between the two periods. Interrupted time series analysis showed significant reductions in the trends of DDD (trend change, -0.65; 95% CI, -1.20 to -0.11) and DOT (trend change, -0.74; 95% CI, -1.33 to -0.15) between the pre-PAF and post-PAF periods. Daily PAF implementation for patients treated with intravenous anti-MRSA agents led to a shorter time to de-escalation and lower consumption of anti-MRSA agents without worsening the clinically important outcomes.",PloS one,2022,Ryo Yamaguchi; Takehito Yamamoto; Koh Okamoto; Keita Tatsuno; Mahoko Ikeda; Takehiro Tanaka; Yoshitaka Wakabayashi; Tomoaki Sato; Shu Okugawa; Kyoji Moriya; Hiroshi Suzuki,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Feedback', 'Humans', 'Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'Retrospective Studies']",[],7
30680565,Clinical outcome of pharmacist-led prospective audit with intervention and feedback after expansion from patients using specific antibiotics to those using whole injectable antibiotics.,"Prospective audit with intervention and feedback (PAF) and preauthorisation of antimicrobials are core strategies for antimicrobial stewardship (AS). PAF participants were expanded from patients using specific antibiotics to those using whole injectable antibiotics to evaluate clinical outcome. From January 2016 to December 2016, PAF was performed in patients using specific antibiotics (period 1) and from January 2017 to December 2017, PAF was performed in patients using whole injectable antibiotics (period 2). PAF was implemented for 5 days every week by pharmacists involved in infectious diseases chemotherapy. In total, 11,571 and 11,103 patients used antibiotic injections during periods 1 and 2, respectively. No significant difference in mortality within 30 days from the initial use of injection antibiotics was observed. The average duration of hospitalisation was significantly shorter during period 2 among patients using antibiotics; however, this was not significantly different from that of patients not receiving antibiotics. The average duration of therapy for intravenous antibiotics was significantly shorter during period 2 than during period 1. The ratio of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to S. aureus was significantly low during period 2. The duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy for Escherichia coli bacteraemia during period 2 decreased significantly. De-escalation and appropriate antimicrobial treatment rates at specific doses during period 2 increased significantly. Expansion of patients eligible for PAF from patients using specific antibiotics to patients using whole injectable antibiotics shortened hospital stays, suppressed drug resistance, and promoted the appropriate use of antibiotics.",European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,2019,Kengo Ohashi; Tomoko Matsuoka; Yasutaka Shinoda; Takayuki Mori; Shinya Yoshida; Tomoaki Yoshimura; Tadashi Sugiyama,"['Administration, Intravenous', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Controlled Before-After Studies', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Drug Utilization', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical Overuse', 'Pharmacists', 'Program Evaluation']","['Antimicrobial resistance', 'Antimicrobial stewardship', 'Intervention', 'Japan', 'Pharmacist', 'Prospective audit with intervention and feedback']",6
31545768,Educational ICU Antimicrobial Stewardship model: the daily activities of the AMS team over a 10-month period.,"The emergence of antibiotic resistance as a consequence of inappropriate use results in higher mortality rates and has become a major public health challenge worldwide. Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) aim to ensure proper use of antimicrobials and reduce health care costs. We assessed the impact of using a behavioral approach during a persuasive ASP on antibiotic appropriateness, consumption and costs. We conducted a prospective interventional cohort before-and-after study in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a 554-bed, university teaching hospital in Terni, Italy, 14 of which are located in the ICU. We describe a 10-month persuasive ASP intervention model used in a referral ICU with daily rounds. The aim of the study was to improve medication appropriateness through educational action and reduce the consumption of carbapenems and echinocandins by conducting post-prescription reviews, prescribing reviews and holding daily discussions with the ICU team. We analyzed the prescribing appropriateness of the ICU team in accordance with the decisions made by the Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) team to improve the quality of antibiotic prescribing during the first five months and the last five months of the surveillance period. The results were expressed as the defined daily dose (DDD) per 100 occupied bed-days and costs. The data were compared with those previously obtained during the pre-educational period (the year before ASP implementation). Comparisons were made between the decisions taken to improve antimicrobial treatments administered during the first half of the surveillance period (March-July) and those administered during the second half (August-December). In all, 116 decisions were made from March to July while only 65 were made from August to December (p-value 0.00001). A significant reduction was observed in the consumption of carbapenems and echinocandins (11.15% and 25.62%, respectively). Total antibiotic cost savings amounted to 57,541.16 euros. The persuasive ASP strategy positively influenced the prescribing behavior of physicians, thus improving the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy and reducing antimicrobial consumption.",Le infezioni in medicina,2019,Stefano Cappanera; Beatrice Tiri; Giulia Priante; Emanuela Sensi; Marialaura Scarcella; Lorenzina Bolli; Monya Costantini; Paolo Andreani; Susanna Sodo; Lucia Assunta Martella; Daniela Francisci,"['Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Carbapenems', 'Controlled Before-After Studies', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Echinocandins', 'Hospitals, Teaching', 'Humans', 'Inappropriate Prescribing', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Italy', 'Models, Organizational', 'Prospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",[],6
32088130,The effect of preauthorization and prospective audit and feedback system on oral antimicrobial prescription for outpatients at a children's hospital in Japan.,"Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP) for oral antibiotics is still uncommon, despite the fact that oral antibiotics prescription accounts for 90% of total antibiotic consumption in developed countries. We introduced preauthorization and prospective audit and feedback (PAF) system on broad-spectrum oral antimicrobials as a part of ASP intervention from October 2015 in a tertiary children's hospital in Japan. Antimicrobial consumption and cost of targeted oral antimicrobials decreased from 11.1 days of therapy (DOT) per 1000 outpatient visits and 860,040 yen ($ 7167: 1 $ = 120 yen) to 1.9 DOT per 1000 outpatient visits and 142,200 yen ($ 1185) annually, respectively (p < 0.001). Interrupted time-series analysis showed that prescriptions for targeted antimicrobials decreased rapidly after initiation of preauthorization (p < 0.001). Prescriptions for non-targeted oral antimicrobial increased temporarily (p < 0.001), but a decreasing trend was found after the initiation (p < 0.001). In pre-intervention period, the main indications for using targeted antimicrobials were upper and lower respiratory infection, urinary tract infections, prophylaxis for medical procedures and otitis media, but only 21.4% of them were appropriate prescription. The appropriate prescription rate of post -intervention period increased to 58.5%. During the study period, the susceptibility pattern of major bacteria to these antimicrobials did not change. In conclusion, introduction of the preauthorization and PAF for selected oral antimicrobials decreased the antimicrobial use of both targeted and non-targeted antimicrobials. This intervention may be an effective method of ASP for other children's hospitals.",Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,2020,Noriko Kinoshita; Makoto Komura; Shinya Tsuzuki; Kensuke Shoji; Isao Miyairi,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Drug Utilization Review', 'Humans', 'Inappropriate Prescribing', 'Interrupted Time Series Analysis', 'Japan', 'Medical Audit', 'Non-Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Outpatients', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Young Adult']","['Antimicrobial stewardship', 'Children', 'Oral antimicrobials', 'Preauthorization', 'Prospective audit and feedback']",6
34564550,Strategies Used for Implementing and Promoting Adherence to Antibiotic Guidelines in Low- and Lower-Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review.,"Containing antimicrobial resistance and reducing high levels of antibiotic consumption in low- and lower middle-income countries are a major challenge. Clinical guidelines targeting antibiotic prescribing can reduce consumption, however, the degrees to which clinical guidelines are adopted and adhered to are challenging for developers, policy makers and users. The aim of this study was to review the strategies used for implementing and promoting antibiotic guideline adherence in low- and lower middle-income countries. A review of published literature was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS and the information systems of the World Health Organization and the Australian National University according to PRISMA guidelines and our PROSPERO protocol. The strategies were grouped into five broad categories based on the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care taxonomy. The 33 selected studies, representing 16 countries varied widely in design, setting, disease focus, methods, intervention components, outcomes and effects. The majority of interventions were multifaceted and resulted in a positive direction of effect. The nature of the interventions and study variability made it impossible to tease out which strategies had the greatest impact on improving CG compliance. Audit and feedback coupled with either workshops and/or focus group discussions were the most frequently used intervention components. All the reported strategies are established practices used in antimicrobial stewardship programs in high-income countries. We recommend interrupted time series studies be used as an alternative design to pre- and post-intervention studies, information about the clinical guidelines be made more transparent, and prescriber confidence be investigated.",Tropical medicine and infectious disease,2021,Nicola D Foxlee; Nicola Townell; Claire Heney; Lachlan McIver; Colleen L Lau,[],"['antibiotics', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'antimicrobial stewardship', 'clinical guidelines', 'low- and lower-middle-income countries', 'prescribing practices']",6
28002979,Antibiotic stewardship in community-acquired pneumonia.,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) continues to be associated with significant mortality and morbidity. As with other infectious diseases, in recent years there has been a marked increase in resistance to the antibiotics commonly used against the pathogens that cause CAP. Antimicrobial stewardship denotes coordinated interventions to improve and measure the appropriate use of antibiotics by encouraging the selection of optimal drug regimens. Areas covered: Several elements can be applied to antibiotic stewardship strategies for CAP in order to maintain or improve patient outcomes. In this regard, antibiotic de-escalation, duration of antibiotic treatment, adherence to CAP guidelines recommendations about empirical treatment, and switching from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy may each be relevant in this context. Antimicrobial stewardship strategies, such as prospective audit with intervention and feedback, clinical pathways, and dedicated multidisciplinary teams, that have included some of these elements have demonstrated improvements in antimicrobial use for CAP without negatively affecting clinical outcomes. Expert commentary: Although there are a limited number of randomized clinical studies addressing antimicrobial stewardship strategies in CAP, there is evidence that antibiotic stewardship initiatives can be securely applied, providing benefits to both healthcare systems and patients.",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,2017,Diego Viasus; Milly Vecino-Moreno; Juan M De La Hoz; Jordi Carratalà,"['Administration, Intravenous', 'Administration, Oral', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Community-Acquired Infections', 'Disease Management', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Dosage Calculations', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Humans', 'Pneumonia, Bacterial', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic']","['Antibiotic', 'antimicrobial-resistance', 'community-acquired pneumonia', 'outcomes', 'stewardship']",6

27277136,Assessment of Time to Clinical Response in Patients with Sepsis Treated Before and After Implementation of a Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight Blood Culture Identification Algorithm.,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate time to clinical response before and after implementation of rapid blood culture identification technologies. DESIGN Before-and-after trial. SETTING Large, tertiary, urban, academic health-sciences center. PATIENTS Patients >18 years old with sepsis and concurrent bacteremia or fungemia were included in the study; patients who were pregnant, had polymicrobial septicemia, or were transferred from an outside hospital were excluded. INTERVENTION Prior to the intervention, polymerase chain reaction was used to identify Staphylococcus species from positive blood cultures, and traditional laboratory techniques were used to identify non-staphylococcal species. After the intervention, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) assay and FilmArray were also used to identify additional species. During both periods, the antimicrobial stewardship team provided prospective audit and feedback for all patients on antibiotics. RESULTS A total of 219 patients were enrolled in the study: 115 patients prior to the intervention and 104 after the intervention. The median time to clinical response was statistically significantly shorter in the postintervention group than in the preintervention group (2 days vs 4 days, respectively; P=.002). By Cox regression, the implementation of MALDI-TOF and FilmArray was associated with shorter time to clinical response (hazard ratio [HR], 1.360; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.018-1.816). After controlling for potential confounders, the study group was not independently associated with clinical response (adjusted HR, 1.279; 95% CI, 0.955-1.713). Mortality was numerically, but not statistically significantly, lower in the postintervention group than in the preintervention group (7.6% vs 11.4%; P=.342). CONCLUSIONS In the setting of an existing antimicrobial stewardship program, implementation of MALDI-TOF and FilmArray was associated with improved time to clinical response. Further research is needed to fully describe the effect of antimicrobial stewardship programs on time to clinical response.

37887258,Antimicrobial Stewardship in the Hospital Setting: A Narrative Review.,"The increasing global threat of antibiotic resistance, which has resulted in countless fatalities due to untreatable infections, underscores the urgent need for a strategic action plan. The acknowledgment that humanity is perilously approaching the ""End of the Miracle Drugs"" due to the unjustifiable overuse and misuse of antibiotics has prompted a critical reassessment of their usage. In response, numerous relevant medical societies have initiated a concerted effort to combat resistance by implementing antibiotic stewardship programs within healthcare institutions, grounded in evidence-based guidelines and designed to guide antibiotic utilization. Crucial to this initiative is the establishment of multidisciplinary teams within each hospital, led by a dedicated Infectious Diseases physician. This team includes clinical pharmacists, clinical microbiologists, hospital epidemiologists, infection control experts, and specialized nurses who receive intensive training in the field. These teams have evidence-supported strategies aiming to mitigate resistance, such as conducting prospective audits and providing feedback, including the innovative 'Handshake Stewardship' approach, implementing formulary restrictions and preauthorization protocols, disseminating educational materials, promoting antibiotic de-escalation practices, employing rapid diagnostic techniques, and enhancing infection prevention and control measures. While initial outcomes have demonstrated success in reducing resistance rates, ongoing research is imperative to explore novel stewardship interventions.","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Helen Giamarellou; Lamprini Galani; Theodoros Karavasilis; Konstantinos Ioannidis; Ilias Karaiskos,[],"['antibiotics', 'audit', 'de-escalation', 'feedback', 'handshake', 'preauthorization', 'resistance', 'restriction', 'stewardship', 'surgical prophylaxis']",6

35326835,Clinical and Microbiological Effects of an Antimicrobial Stewardship Program in Urology-A Single Center Before-After Study.,"Antimicrobial resistance is a major public health issue caused by antibiotic overuse and misuse. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) has been increasingly endorsed worldwide, but its effect has been studied scarcely in urologic settings. A before-after study was performed from 2018 through 2020 to evaluate changes in antimicrobial prescription, resistance rates and clinical safety upon implementation of an AMS audit and feedback program in the Urology Department of a large German academic medical center. The primary endpoints were safety clinical outcomes: the rate of infection-related readmissions and of infectious complications after transrectal prostate biopsies. Resistance rates and antimicrobial consumption rates were the secondary endpoints. The AMS team reviewed 196 cases (12% of all admitted in the department). The overall antibiotic use dropped by 18.7%. Quinolone prescriptions sank by 78.8% (p = 0.02) and 69.8% (p > 0.05) for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, respectively. The resistance rate of E. coli isolates declined against ceftriaxone (−9%), ceftazidime (−12%) and quinolones (−25%) in the AMS period. No significant increase in infection-related readmissions or infectious complications after prostate biopsies was observed (p = 0.42). Due to the potential to reduce antibiotic use and resistance rates with no surge of infection-related complications, AMS programs should be widely implemented in urologic departments.","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Oana Joean; Daniel Tahedl; Madita Flintrop; Thorben Winkler; Ruxandra Sabau; Tobias Welte; Markus A Kuczyk; Ralf-Peter Vonberg; Jessica Rademacher,[],"['antibiotics', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'antimicrobial stewardship', 'quinolone', 'urology']",6
36100471,Optimization of antimicrobial prescription in the hospital.,"Internal Medicine wards are an appropriate focus of antibiotic stewardship, along with emergency departments and intensive care units, because a large proportion of patients are with parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics. Given the unmet clinical need of antibiotic optimization in the hospital and the importance of front-line practitioners for antibiotic stewardship, the barriers and tactics to overcome them were discussed in a round table at the European Congress of Internal Medicine. Better rapid diagnostic tests should help to increase appropriate early antibiotic rates, favoring diversity in antibiotic choices adapted to the awareness of local resistance patterns. Providing such is a greater challenge in low-resource settings. Prescriptions should be personalized, adjusting dosage and source control to specific patients' conditions. Shorter antibiotic duration and de-escalation are major drivers to reduce adverse events, with mortality and recurrence rates being independent of antimicrobial duration. Appropriate diagnostic tests with quick turnaround times decrease excessive antibiotic use. Antimicrobial optimization requires a multidisciplinary approach and it should be a core competence of training specialists, improving opportunities to provide safer patient care.",European journal of internal medicine,2022,T Vieceli; J Rello,"['Humans', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Prescriptions', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Hospitals']","['Antibiotic clinical practice guidelines', 'Antimicrobial resistance', 'Antimicrobial stewardship', 'Bloodstream infection', 'Multidrug resistant microorganisms', 'Sepsis']",6
36111208,Early appropriate diagnostics and treatment of MDR Gram-negative infections.,"The term difficult-to-treat resistance has been recently coined to identify Gram-negative bacteria exhibiting resistance to all fluoroquinolones and all β-lactam categories, including carbapenems. Such bacteria are posing serious challenges to clinicians trying to identify the best therapeutic option for any given patient. Delayed appropriate therapy has been associated with worse outcomes including increase in length of stay, increase in total in-hospital costs and ∼20% increase in the risk of in-hospital mortality. In addition, time to appropriate antibiotic therapy has been shown to be an independent predictor of 30 day mortality in patients with resistant organisms. Improving and anticipating aetiological diagnosis through optimizing not only the identification of phenotypic resistance to antibiotic classes/agents, but also the identification of specific resistance mechanisms, would have a major impact on reducing the frequency and duration of inappropriate early antibiotic therapy. In light of these considerations, the present paper reviews the increasing need for rapid diagnosis of bacterial infections and efficient laboratory workflows to confirm diagnoses and facilitate prompt de-escalation to targeted therapy, in line with antimicrobial stewardship principles. Rapid diagnostic tests currently available and future perspectives for their use are discussed. Early appropriate diagnostics and treatment of MDR Gram-negative infections require a multidisciplinary approach that includes multiple different diagnostic methods and further consensus of algorithms, protocols and guidelines to select the optimal antibiotic therapy.",JAC-antimicrobial resistance,2022,Matteo Bassetti; Souha S Kanj; Pattarachai Kiratisin; Camilla Rodrigues; David Van Duin; María Virginia Villegas; Yunsong Yu,[],[],6

38301713,Risk of Multidrug-Resistant Pathogens in Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia.,"Severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) is difficult to treat when caused by difficult-to-treat (DTR) pathogens because of limited treatment options and poorer clinical outcomes. Over time, several predictive scoring systems based on risk factors for infection with multidrug resistant pathogens have been developed. We reviewed the available tools for identifying DTR pathogens as the cause of SCAP, both predictive scoring systems and rapid diagnostic methods, to develop management strategies aimed at early identification of DTR pathogens, reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic use and improving clinical outcomes. The scoring systems reviewed show considerable heterogeneity among them at the level of the region studied, the definition of risk factors, as well as which DTR pathogens are the target pathogens. The models described have shown limited effectiveness in reducing inappropriate antibiotic treatment or improving patient outcomes by themselves. However, predictive models could serve as a first step in identifying DTR pathogen infections as part of a larger detection algorithm. Rapid diagnostic tools, such as multiplex polymerase chain reaction, would be useful for the rapid identification of pneumonia-causing pathogens and their resistance mechanisms. In resource-limited settings, rapid tests should be limited to patients at high risk of developing SCAP due to DTR pathogens. We propose an integrative algorithm based on the different scores, taking into account local epidemiological data, where ideally each center should have an antimicrobial stewardship program.",Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,2024,E Campaña-Duel; M Camprubí-Rimblas; A Areny-Balagueró; Sara Quero; A Artigas; Adrian Ceccato,"['Humans', 'Pneumonia', 'Community-Acquired Infections', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Assessment']",[],6

38186441,The Role of Clinical Pharmacists in Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs): A Systematic Review.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global health threat, increasing deaths and healthcare costs. Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) have been implemented to optimize antibiotic use and curb resistance. This systematic review aimed to summarize evidence on the role and impact of pharmacists in hospital ASPs. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across databases to identify relevant studies published from 2016 to 2023. Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising global observational and randomized clinical trials. Pharmacists performed various stewardship activities, including prospective audits, formulary management, de-escalation, guideline development, and education. Pharmacist-led interventions significantly improved antibiotic prescribing, reduced unnecessary antibiotic use, optimized therapy, and enhanced outcomes. Multiple studies found that pharmacist reviews decreased the time to optimal antibiotics and improved guideline compliance without affecting readmissions or revisits. De-escalation programs safely reduced antibiotic duration and length of stay. Acceptance rates for recommendations were high. Pharmacist stewardship curbed overall antibiotic use, costs, and duration across hospital departments, leading to savings. While most studies showed positive impacts, fewer detected significant changes in resistance or mortality over short periods. More research is needed, but current evidence demonstrates that pharmacists play critical roles in ASPs, leading to improved antibiotic use and patient outcomes. These findings support integrating pharmacists into stewardship activities, significantly extending programs to ambulatory settings.",Cureus,2023,Ibrahim M Dighriri; Bayader A Alnomci; Mashael M Aljahdali; Hadeel S Althagafi; Raghad M Almatrafi; Wasan G Altwairqi; Ashwaq A Almagati; Abdulaziz M Shunaymir; Ghadeer A Haidarah; Mohmmad H Alanzi; Abdullatif A Hadadi; Hind M Suwaydi; Maha J Aqdi; Hamed N Alharthi; Amaal F Alshahrani,[],"['antimicrobial management', 'antimicrobial stewardship', 'antimicrobial stewardship practice', 'clinical pharmacists', 'pharmacies']",6
14586487,Cycling chemotherapy: a promising approach to reducing the morbidity and mortality of nosocomial infections.,"In the past several decades, nosocomial infections have emerged as one of the most serious contributors to hospital morbidity and mortality, particularly amongst patients who require intensive care. Resistant organisms, both Gram-negative and Gram-positive, are now to blame for a significant portion of hospital-acquired infections. Efforts to prevent nosocomial infection had historically focused on infection control measures, such as patient isolation. However, there have been numerous reports of the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance, as well as the dramatic, negative impact of the infections they cause, both in terms of patient outcomes and attributable costs, demanding new methods to halt this growing epidemic. The increasing threat of resistance may be attributed in part to the widespread and increasingly inappropriate use of antimicrobials, which inadvertently exert sufficient effect on the hospital (and now community) environment to allow the preferential selection of resistant microbes. This idea of selective antibiotic pressure is supported by data showing volume of antibiotic use and inadequate antimicrobial coverage as risk factors for increased morbidity and mortality. Accordingly, the focus of nosocomial infection control has now largely shifted towards the judicious use of antibiotic therapy. There have been numerous attempts to curtail antibiotic usage through various forms of antibiotic stewardship: formulary restriction, computerized decision-support and abbreviated course empiric therapy. Aside from the inherent difficulty of effecting change in physician practice, we are burdened, particularly in the setting of empiric therapy, with the need to balance between adequate therapy for the individual and prudent drug selection so as not to endanger other patients in the environment through resistant organism selection. Cycling chemotherapy for empiric treatment of suspected infection is a method uniquely designed to address these challenges.","Drugs of today (Barcelona, Spain : 1998)",2003,Heather L Evans; Robert G Sawyer,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Cross Infection', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy', 'Humans', 'Morbidity', 'United States']",[],5

The objectives of the present study were to evaluate (1) the impact of an AS intervention on antibiotic consumption and (2) the applicability and acceptance rate of the intervention and its clinical impact. A persuasive AS intervention based on European Conference on Infection in Leukaemia (ECIL) guidelines for FN was implemented in a high-risk hematology ward in a tertiary referral public university hospital. This included the creation and diffusion of flow charts on de-escalation and discontinuation of antibiotics for FN, and the introduction in the team of a doctor dedicated to the implementation of flow charts and to antibiotic prescription revision. All consecutive patients receiving antibiotics during hospitalization were included. A segmented linear regression model was performed for the evaluation of antibiotic consumption, taking into account 1-year pre-intervention period and 6-month intervention period. Overall, 137 consecutive antibiotic prescriptions were re-evaluated, 100 prescriptions were for FN. A significant reduction of the level of carbapenem consumption was observed during the intervention period (level change (estimate coefficient ± standard error) = - 135.28 ± 59.49; p = 0.04). Applicability and acceptability of flow charts were high. No differences in terms of intensive care unit transfers, bacteremia incidence, and mortality were found.

39847251,Antibiotics for Paediatric Community-Acquired Pneumonia: What is the Optimal Course Duration?,"Despite significant global reductions in cases of pneumonia during the last 3 decades, pneumonia remains the leading cause of post-neonatal mortality in children aged <5 years. Beyond the immediate disease burden it imposes, pneumonia contributes to long-term morbidity, including lung function deficits and bronchiectasis. Viruses are the most common cause of childhood pneumonia, but bacteria also play a crucial role. However, the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for bacterial pneumonia remains uncertain in both low- and middle-income countries and in high-income countries. Knowing the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for pneumonia is crucial for effective antimicrobial stewardship. This is especially important as concerns mount over rising antibiotic resistance in respiratory bacterial pathogens, which increases the risk of treatment failure. Numerous studies have focused on the duration of oral antibiotics and short-term outcomes, such as clinical cure and mortality. In contrast, only one study has examined both intravenous and oral antibiotics and their impact on long-term respiratory outcomes following pneumonia hospitalisation. However, study findings may be influenced by their inclusion criteria when children unlikely to have bacterial pneumonia are included. Efforts to differentiate between bacterial and non-bacterial pneumonia continue, but a validated, accurate, and simple point-of-care diagnostic test remains elusive. Without certainty that a child has bacterial pneumonia, determining the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment is challenging. This review examines the evidence for the recommended duration of antibiotics for treating uncomplicated pneumonia in otherwise healthy children and concludes that the question of duration is unresolved.",Paediatric drugs,2025,Hing Cheong Kok; Anne B Chang; Siew Moy Fong; Gabrielle B McCallum; Stephanie T Yerkovich; Keith Grimwood,"['Humans', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Community-Acquired Infections', 'Child', 'Pneumonia, Bacterial', 'Child, Preschool', 'Pneumonia', 'Infant', 'Community-Acquired Pneumonia']",[],5
26598095,Making a Case for Pediatric Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs.,"Although antimicrobials are commonly used in children, it is important to remember that they can have a profound impact on this unique patient population. Inadvertent consequences of antiinfective use in children include antimicrobial resistance, infection caused by Clostridium difficile, increased risk of obesity, and adverse drug events. In addition, compared with adults, children have different dosing requirements, antimicrobial formulation needs, pharmacokinetics, and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. Therefore, pediatric-specific antimicrobial stewardship efforts are needed to promote appropriate use of antimicrobials in children. The primary purposes of this review article are to provide a rationale behind pediatric-focused antimicrobial stewardship and to describe currently available evidence regarding the initiatives of pediatric antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs). A literature search of the Medline database was performed (from inception through March 2015). The studies included in this review focus on antimicrobial stewardship interventions in inpatient pediatric settings. Ten inpatient studies involving pediatric-focused antimicrobial stewardship interventions were identified from the published literature. Four studies used the core strategy of prospective audit with feedback; two used prior approval. The remaining four used supplemental antimicrobial stewardship strategies (guidelines, clinical pathways, and computerized decision support tools). In general, the interventions resulted in decreased antimicrobial use, reduced antimicrobial costs, and fewer prescribing errors. Children have unique medical needs related to antimicrobials and deserve focused ASP efforts. The literature regarding pediatric antimicrobial stewardship interventions is limited, but published interventions may serve as paradigms for developing pediatric ASPs as demonstrated by the general success of these interventions.",Pharmacotherapy,2015,Heather K Magsarili; Jennifer E Girotto; Nicholas J Bennett; David P Nicolau,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Humans', 'Inappropriate Prescribing', 'Medication Therapy Management', 'Pediatrics']","['antibiotics', 'antimicrobial stewardship', 'children', 'pediatrics']",5

31585481,Controlling the Diffusion of Multidrug-Resistant Organisms in Intensive Care Units.,"The prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) in intensive care units (ICUs) is increasing worldwide, with very large variations across countries, microorganisms, and settings. Emerging MDR gram-negative bacteria and fungi raise particular concerns that require improved prevention and control strategies. Vertical approaches are mainly based on screening and contact precautions and/or decolonization of MDRO carriers. On the other hand, horizontal strategies are not pathogen-specific and include standard precautions (i.e., hand hygiene), universal decolonization, antimicrobial stewardship, and environmental cleaning. The impacts of the different strategies vary between MDROs and compliance with control measures, and are intermixed in most infection control programs. Based on historical data, hand hygiene remains the cornerstone to prevent transmission of MDROs in ICUs. In the context of high hand hygiene compliance, screening and contact precautions for carriers seem to have a limited additional effect, particularly for MDR gram-negative bacteria. Studies on skin decolonization with chlorhexidine bathing show conflicting results, impairing its widespread adoption. Selective oral and digestive decontaminations have shown positive impact on clinical outcomes in ICUs with low levels of antibiotic resistance, but raised ecological concerns in high-prevalence settings. Antibiotic stewardship programs have been associated with reductions in antimicrobial use, duration of stay, and costs with no negative impact on mortality and should be widely promoted in ICUs. Whatever the strategy, compliance with the recommended measures is of crucial importance and implementation should rely on behavioral approach and change in the institutional and safety culture.",Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,2019,Solen Kernéis; Jean-Christophe Lucet,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Carrier State', 'Critical Care', 'Cross Infection', 'Decontamination', 'Disinfectants', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Hand Disinfection', 'Humans', 'Infection Control', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Staphylococcal Infections']",[],5

Reduction in antibiotic consumption is clearly important to minimize this problem. Limiting treatment duration may be the most clinically palatable means of reducing antibiotic consumption. Antimicrobial stewardship programs play an important role in this process. Their effectiveness may be increased by drawing on evidence from randomized controlled trials regarding optimal antibiotic duration. However, in most clinical scenarios, the recommended duration of therapy in published guidelines is based on expert opinion. Biological markers, such as procalcitonin, have been shown to reduce antimicrobial consumption with no adverse outcome in 11 randomized controlled trials.

The current state-of-the-art in SAP is reviewed, including antibiotic selection, timing, dosing, intraoperative redosing, and the avoidance of unnecessary postoperative administration. Key intra- and postoperative measures to reduce the risk of SSI are covered, including glycaemic control, body temperature management, goal-directed fluid therapy, and skin antisepsis. A critical appraisal of the supporting evidence is included, with emphasis on areas of ongoing debate. The final section outlines future research priorities: optimizing dosing in obese patients, evaluating continuous infusion, tailoring prophylaxis to surgical site and microbiome, and addressing the management of patients colonized with multidrug-resistant organisms. Non-antibiotic strategies and rapid diagnostic tests are also discussed as promising avenues to enhance precision in infection prevention. By integrating current knowledge with emerging perspectives, this review aims to support the refinement of SSI prevention strategies and contribute to antimicrobial stewardship in modern surgical practice.","Anaesthesia, critical care & pain medicine",2025,Marc Garnier; Quentin Saint-Genis; Claire Roger; Romain Guilhaumou; Marc Leone; Matthieu Boisson,[],"['Prevention', 'Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis', 'Surgical site infection']",5

34682223,Lessons from an Educational Invasive Fungal Disease Conference on Hospital Antifungal Stewardship Practices across the UK and Ireland.,"Invasive fungal disease (IFD) is a growing health burden. High mortality rates, increasing numbers of at-risk hosts, and a limited availability of rapid diagnostics and therapeutic options mean that patients are increasingly exposed to unnecessary antifungals. High rates of prescriptions promote patient exposure to undue toxicity and drive the emergence of resistance. Antifungal stewardship (AFS) aims to guide antifungal usage and reduce unnecessary exposure and antifungal consumption whilst maintaining or improving outcomes. Here, we examine several AFS approaches from hospitals across the UK and Ireland to demonstrate the benefits of AFS practices and support the broader implementation of AFS as both a necessary and achievable strategy. Since the accuracy and turnaround times (TATs) of diagnostic tools can impact treatment decisions, several AFS strategies have included the development and implementation of diagnostic-driven care pathways. AFS informed treatment strategies can help stratify patients on a risk basis ensuring the right patients receive antifungals at the optimal time. Using a multidisciplinary approach is also key due to the complexity of managing and treating patients at risk of IFD. Through knowledge sharing, such as The Gilead Antifungal Information Network (GAIN), we hope to drive practices that improve patient management and support the preservation of antifungals for future use.","Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Alida Fe Talento; Malcolm Qualie; Laura Cottom; Matthijs Backx; P Lewis White,[],"['antifungal resistance', 'antifungal therapy', 'antimicrobial management', 'aspergillosis', 'candidiasis', 'diagnostics', 'fungal infections', 'guidelines', 'surveillance', 'treatment']",5

This study analysed the effect of a multimodal ICU AMS introduced in a 15-bed medical-surgical tertiary Australian adult ICU in November 2008, using interrupted time-series analysis of antibiotic usage, Gram-negative resistance and cost from November 2005 to October 2015, including national ICU average usage as a control. Overall ICU mortality, 30-day blood stream infection (BSI) mortality and length of stay (LOS) were compared over the same period. There were 2512 patients admitted to ICU before and 6435 after AMS intervention. Post-AMS there was a reduction in the trend of aminoglycoside usage both absolute from 63.3 DDD/1000 occupied bed days (OBD)/month (-1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.2, -0.1; P = 0.033) and relative to the national trend (-1.3; 95%CI -2.4, -0.3; P = 0.016). Vancomycin usage increased both absolute from 161.2 DDD/1000 OBD/month (1.8; 95%CI 0.03, 3.6; P = 0.046) and relative to the national trend (1.8; 95%CI -0.3, 3.9; P = 0.092). There were sustained post-AMS downward trends in carbapenem, antipseudomonal penicillin, third-generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone use that did not reach statistical significance. Post-AMS, antipseudomonal penicillin resistance declined (-12.8%; 95%CI -24.9, -0.6; P = 0.040). Antimicrobial acquisition costs declined by AUD$0.5/OBD/month (95%CI -1.1, 0.1; P = 0.096). Over the study period, severity-adjusted ICU mortality declined from 12.9% to 10.4%; risk ratio (RR) 0.92 (95%CI 0.82, 1.03) and BSI 30-day mortality from 37.9% to 26.3%; RR, 0.76 (95%CI 0.56, 1.03). Median ICU LOS for ICU survivors increased from 2.3 to 2.6 days.

38081051,Qualitative Assessment of a Smartphone-Based Mobile Health Tool to Guide Diarrhea Management in Bangladesh.,"Diarrheal diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide and a significant contributor to antimicrobial resistance. In the absence of laboratory diagnostics to establish diarrhea etiology, electronic clinical decision support tools can help physicians make informed treatment decisions for children with diarrhea. In Bangladesh, we assessed the feasibility and acceptability of an electronic Diarrhea Etiology Prediction algorithm (DEP tool) embedded into a rehydration calculator, which was designed to help physicians manage children with diarrhea, including decisions on antibiotic use. A team of Bangladeshi anthropologists conducted in-depth interviews with physicians (N = 13) in three public hospitals in Bangladesh about their experience using the tool in the context of a pilot trial. Physicians expressed positive opinions of the DEP tool. Participants perceived the tool to be simple and easy to use, with structured guidance on collecting and entering clinical data from patients. Significant strengths of the tool were as follows: standardization of protocol, efficiency of clinical decision-making, and improved clinical practice. Participants also noted barriers that might restrict the widespread impact of the tool, including physicians' reluctance to use an electronic tool for clinical decision-making, increasing work in overburdened healthcare settings, unavailability of a smartphone, and patients' preferences for antibiotics. We conclude that an electronic clinical decision support tool is a promising method for improving diarrheal management and antibiotic stewardship. Future directions include developing and implementing such a tool for informal healthcare physicians in low-resource settings, where families may first seek care for pediatric diarrhea.",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2024,Debashish Biswas; Asadullah Asadullah; Sazzad Hossain Khan; Zahid Hasan Khan; Md Taufiqul Islam; Ashraful Islam Khan; Firdausi Qadri; Eric J Nelson; Melissa H Watt; Daniel T Leung,"['Humans', 'Child', 'Smartphone', 'Bangladesh', 'Diarrhea', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Telemedicine']",[],5

38136719,Primary Care Antibiotic Prescribing and Infection-Related Hospitalisation.,"Inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics has been widely recognised as a leading cause of antimicrobial resistance, which in turn has become one of the most significant threats to global health. Given that most antibiotic prescriptions are issued in primary care settings, investigating the associations between primary care prescribing of antibiotics and subsequent infection-related hospitalisations affords a valuable opportunity to understand the long-term health implications of primary care antibiotic intervention. A narrative review of the scientific literature studying associations between primary care antibiotic prescribing and subsequent infection-related hospitalisation was conducted. The Web of Science database was used to retrieve 252 potentially relevant studies, with 23 of these studies included in this review (stratified by patient age and infection type). The majority of studies (n = 18) were published in the United Kingdom, while the remainder were conducted in Germany, Spain, Denmark, New Zealand, and the United States. While some of the reviewed studies demonstrated that appropriate and timely antibiotic prescribing in primary care could help reduce the need for hospitalisation, excessive antibiotic prescribing can lead to antimicrobial resistance, subsequently increasing the risk of infection-related hospitalisation. Few studies reported no association between primary care antibiotic prescriptions and subsequent infection-related hospitalisation. Overall, the disparate results in the extant literature attest to the conflicting factors influencing the decision-making regarding antibiotic prescribing and highlight the necessity of adopting a more patient-focussed perspective in stewardship programmes and the need for increased use of rapid diagnostic testing in primary care.","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Stein Gerrit Paul Menting; Enya Redican; Jamie Murphy; Magda Bucholc,[],"['antibiotics', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'hospitalisation', 'primary care']",5
35970382,Impact of antimicrobial stewardship interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing for hospital inpatients in Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) interventions to improve antibiotic use are being implemented in Africa, but their impact is not fully known. The aim of this review was to estimate the effectiveness of interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing for hospital inpatients. Studies from PubMed, Embase, African Journals Online and Google Scholar were systematically searched from January 2010 to July 2022. Studies were included if they reported the impact of AMS interventions on outcomes of interest for hospital inpatients in Africa. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care guidelines and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute tool. Findings were summarized in tables and meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models. A total of 28 studies were included, 89% being uncontrolled before and after studies. Most interventions employed were multi-faceted and found to be effective, evidenced by increased compliance, reduction in antibiotic utilization and cost, and slight reduction or no difference in mortality and length of hospital stay (LOS). Meta-analysis generated a relative risk of 0.82 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.97] for mortality, and a standard mean difference of -0.30 (95% CI -0.41 to -0.19) for LOS. Generally, a decrease in resistance to most micro-organisms was observed. Despite an increase in the number of AMS studies conducted in Africa, the studies lack most of the quality design features for AMS studies. In conclusion, antimicrobial stewardship interventions are likely to be effective; however, efforts are still required to align the study design with the quality design features required for validity and to inform practice.",The Journal of hospital infection,2022,L Siachalinga; W Mufwambi; I-H Lee,"['Humans', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Inpatients', 'Length of Stay', 'Hospitals']","['Antibiotic prescribing', 'Antimicrobial stewardship', 'Hospital', 'Inpatient']",5
35042878,The impact of antimicrobial stewardship program designed to shorten antibiotics use on the incidence of resistant bacterial infections and mortality.,"Reassessing the continuing need for and choice of antibiotics by using an antibiotic ""time out'' program may reduce unnecessary treatment. This study aimed to explore the effect of an antibiotic stewardship program (ASP) on the antibiotics consumption, incidence of resistant bacterial infections and overall hospital mortality in a tertiary medical center during the study period 2012-2014. An ASP composed of multidisciplinary strategies including pre-prescription approval and post-approval feedback and audit, and a major ""time out'' intervention (shorten the default antibiotic prescription duration) usage was introduced in year 2013. Consumption of antibiotics was quantified by calculating defined daily doses (DDDs). Interrupted time series (ITS) analysis was used to explore the changes of antibiotics consumption before and after intervention, accounting for temporal trends that may be unrelated to intervention. Our results showed that following the intervention, DDDs showed a decreased trend in overall (in particular the major consumed penicillins and cephalosporins), in both intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU, and in non-restrictive versus restrictive antibiotics. Importantly, ITS analysis showed a significantly slope change since intervention (slope change p value 0.007), whereas the incidence of carbapenem-resistant and vancomycin-resistant pathogens did not change significantly. Moreover, annual overall mortality rates were 3.0%, 3.1% and 3.1% from 2012 to 2014, respectively. This study indicates that implementing a multi-disciplinary strategy to shorten the default duration of antibiotic prescription can be an effective manner to reduce antibiotic consumption while not compromising resistant infection incidence or mortality rates.",Scientific reports,2022,Ling-Ju Huang; Su-Jung Chen; Yu-Wen Hu; Chun-Yu Liu; Ping-Feng Wu; Shu-Mei Sun; Shih-Yi Lee; Yin-Yin Chen; Chung-Yuan Lee; Yu-Jiun Chan; Yueh-Ching Chou; Fu-Der Wang,"['Humans', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Incidence', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Interrupted Time Series Analysis', 'Male', 'Female']",[],5
41049455,Nosocomial and Ventilator-associated Pneumonia.,"Nosocomial pneumonia (NP), including its subtype ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), represents a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and increased healthcare utilization in hospitalized patients, particularly in intensive care settings. This comprehensive, question-and-answer formatted review synthesizes current evidence on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of NP and VAP, with a focus on multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). Key distinctions between NP and VAP are explored in terms of microbiological profiles, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic implications. The review provides a detailed analysis of risk factors for MDROs - including prolonged mechanical ventilation, prior antibiotic exposure, and host-related immunosuppression - emphasizing the importance of risk stratification in guiding empirical antibiotic selection. A critical appraisal of international guideline recommendations (IDSA/ATS, ERS, SEPAR) highlights areas of consensus and divergence, particularly regarding empirical treatment strategies and the role of narrow- versus broad-spectrum coverage. The integration of rapid molecular diagnostic tools, such as multiplex PCR, is discussed in depth, including their potential to improve diagnostic yield, facilitate early de-escalation, and enhance antimicrobial stewardship. Recent advances in antimicrobial development are reviewed, covering novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations and siderophore cephalosporins with activity against ESBL-, KPC-, and carbapenemase-producing pathogens. Their appropriate use in critically ill patients is contextualized within the framework of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic optimization. Finally, the review examines current evidence on treatment duration, supporting a 7-8 day course in most cases, with individualized extension in selected high-risk populations. The utility of procalcitonin as a biomarker to guide antibiotic discontinuation is also addressed.

25685719,"Antibiotic stewardship programmes in intensive care units: Why, how, and where are they leading us.","Antibiotic usage and increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) mount significant challenges to patient safety and management of the critically ill on intensive care units (ICU). Antibiotic stewardship programmes (ASPs) aim to optimise appropriate antibiotic treatment whilst minimising antibiotic resistance. Different models of ASP in intensive care setting, include ""standard"" control of antibiotic prescribing such as ""de-escalation strategies""through to interventional approaches utilising biomarker-guided antibiotic prescribing. A systematic review of outcomes related studies for ASPs in an ICU setting was conducted. Forty three studies were identified from MEDLINE between 1996 and 2014. Of 34 non-protocolised studies, [1 randomised control trial (RCT), 22 observational and 11 case series], 29 (85%) were positive with respect to one or more outcome: These were the key outcome of reduced antibiotic use, or ICU length of stay, antibiotic resistance, or prescribing cost burden. Limitations of non-standard antibiotic initiation triggers, patient and antibiotic selection bias or baseline demographic variance were identified. All 9 protocolised studies were RCTs, of which 8 were procalcitonin (PCT) guided antibiotic stop/start interventions. Five studies addressed antibiotic escalation, 3 de-escalation and 1 addressed both. Six studies reported positive outcomes for reduced antibiotic use, ICU length of stay or antibiotic resistance. PCT based ASPs are effective as antibiotic-stop (de-escalation) triggers, but not as an escalation trigger alone. PCT has also been effective in reducing antibiotic usage without worsening morbidity or mortality in ventilator associated pulmonary infection. No study has demonstrated survival benefit of ASP. Ongoing challenges to infectious disease management, reported by the World Health Organisation global report 2014, are high AMR to newer antibiotics, and regional knowledge gaps in AMR surveillance. Improved AMR surveillance data, identifying core aspects of successful ASPs that are transferable, and further well-conducted trials will be necessary if ASPs are to be an effective platform for delivering desired patient outcomes and safety through best antibiotic policy.",World journal of critical care medicine,2015,Yu-Zhi Zhang; Suveer Singh,[],"['Antibacterial resistance', 'Antibiotic resistance', 'Antibiotic stewardship programme', 'Antimicrobial resistance', 'Intensive care']",5

We present a narrative review of the impact of infectious disease specialists (IDSs) on the quality and quantity of antibiotic use in acute-care hospitals, and discuss the main factors that could limit the efficacy of IDS recommendations. A total of 31 studies were included in this review, with a wide range of infections, hospital settings, and types of antibiotic prescription. Seven of 31 studies were randomized controlled trials, before/after controlled studies, or before/after uncontrolled studies with interrupted time-series analysis. In almost all studies, IDS intervention was associated with a significant improvement in the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing as compared with prescriptions without any IDS input, and with decreased antibiotic consumption. Variability in the antibiotic prescribing practices of IDSs, informal (curbside) consultations and the involvement of junior IDSs are among the factors that could have an impact on the efficacy of IDS recommendations and on compliance rates, and deserve further investigation. We also discuss possible drawbacks of IDSs in acute-care hospitals that are rarely reported in the published literature. Overall, IDSs are valuable to antimicrobial stewardship programmes in hospitals, but their impact depends on many human and organizational factors.",Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,2014,C Pulcini; E Botelho-Nevers; O J Dyar; S Harbarth,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Physicians', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']","['antibiotic stewardship', 'antimicrobial', 'appropriateness', 'curbside consultation', 'infectious disease physician', 'interventional studies', 'quality', 'review']",5

This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of our institutional pharmacist-driven prospective audit with intervention and feedback (PAF) on the treatment of patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs). The effect of pharmacist-driven PAF was estimated using an interrupted time series analysis with a quasi-experimental design. The proportion of de-escalation during BSI treatment increased by 44% after the implementation of pharmacist-driven PAF (95% CI: 30−58, p < 0.01). The number of days of therapy decreased by 16 per 100 patient days for carbapenem (95% CI: −28 to −3.5, p = 0.012) and by 15 per 100 patient days for tazobactam/piperacillin (95% CI: −26 to −4.9, p < 0.01). Moreover, the proportion of inappropriate treatment in empirical and definitive therapy was significantly reduced after the implementation of pharmacist-driven PAF. Although 30-day mortality did not change, compliance with evidenced-based bundles in the BSI of Staphylococcus aureus significantly increased (p < 0.01). In conclusion, our pharmacist-driven PAF increased the proportion of de-escalation and decreased the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, as well as the proportion of inappropriate treatment in patients with BSI. This indicates that pharmacist-driven PAF is useful in improving the quality of antimicrobial treatment and reducing broad-spectrum antimicrobial use in the management of patients with BSI.","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Naoto Okada; Momoyo Azuma; Kaito Tsujinaka; Akane Abe; Mari Takahashi; Yumiko Yano; Masami Sato; Takahiro Shibata; Mitsuhiro Goda; Keisuke Ishizawa,[],"['antimicrobial stewardship', 'bloodstream infection', 'pharmacist', 'prospective audit with intervention and feedback']",5

36006251,Antimicrobial Stewardship in Tropical Infectious Diseases: Focusing on Dengue and Malaria.,"Acute undifferentiated febrile illness (AUFI) is the presenting symptom of various tropical and infectious diseases. Viral infection is generally the most common cause of AUFI, accounting for 8-11.8% of cases; thus, antibiotics might be unnecessary. Dengue and malaria are common tropical infectious diseases requiring effective supportive treatment and antimalarial agents, respectively. The uncertainty of early diagnosis results in widespread empirical antimicrobial treatment in high -income as well as in low-and middle-income countries. Although rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been shown to limit antibiotic prescriptions in dengue and malaria, we observed a wide range of antibiotic prescriptions for 13-92.7% of cases in previous literature, particularly in RDT-negative malaria cases. Given several RDT limitations, antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) appears to be an effective strategy for controlling unnecessary antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) prevention. This program should be endorsed by a multidisciplinary team in tropical diseases to control collateral damage of inappropriate antimicrobial use. Empirical antibiotic treatment should be administered based on clinical judgement, microbiological evidence, and local epidemiological data. Rapid termination of antibiotic therapy, including disease control or elimination, is the mainstay of AMS in tropical diseases.

29373980,Do we need new trials of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy?,"Using biomarkers as a guide to tailor the duration of antibiotic treatment in respiratory infections is an attractive hypothesis assessed in several studies. Recent work aiming to summarize the evidence assessed the effect of a procalcitonin (PCT)-guided antibiotic treatment on outcomes in acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), suggesting that significant reductions in antibiotic duration occur when using a PCT-guided algorithm. However, controversial evidence also suggested PCT-guided algorithms were associated with increased antibiotic duration and increased incidence of Clostridium difficile, without any impact on mortality, in real-world settings. So, although using PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship is promising, after more than a decade of randomized controlled trials on this topic the evidence in its favor is still less than compelling due to limitations in trial design, not taking into consideration fundamental aspects of PCT biology, and the absence of evidence-based antimicrobial duration in intervention and control groups. In this commentary we highlight some questions and limitations of primary PCT study data that might impact interpretation and clinical use of PCT at the bedside.","Critical care (London, England)",2018,Thiago Lisboa; Jorge Salluh; Pedro Povoa,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Biomarkers, Pharmacological', 'Calcitonin', 'Humans', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Time Factors']",[],5

Patients prescribed carbapenems for ≥ 2 weeks received intervention. Interrupted time-series analysis was performed to compare antimicrobial consumption before and after intervention. Factors associated with non-adherence to intervention were investigated. Of 273 patients who were eligible for intervention, discontinuation or de-escalation was recommended in 256 (94.1%) and intervention was accepted in 136 (53.1%) patients. Before intervention, carbapenem consumption significantly increased to 1.14 days of therapy (DOT)/1000 patient days (PD)/month (P = 0.018). However, it significantly declined by - 2.01 DOT/1000 PD/month without an increase in other antibiotic consumption (P < 0.001).

However, information on the molecular characterization of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) bloodstream infections in children is scarce. This study aimed to describe the molecular characterization of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii infections in children from a hospital in Mexico. A retrospective study was conducted during the period 2017-2022. Clinical and demographic data were collected from the clinical records. Mass spectrometry was used for the identification of the strains. To confirm A. baumannii strains, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was applied using a gyrB sequence. The carbapenemase-encoding resistance genes were detected by PCR. Six cases of CRAB were documented, including five in neonates. The median intensive care unit stay was 20 days, and all cases had an invasive medical device. Half of the patients had at least one medical condition. A high prevalence of coresistance was observed in most of the antibiotic groups. Three of the six strains coharbored carbapenemase genes: blaOXA-51, blaOXA-24, and blaIMP. Mortality was reported in two neonate patients. The present study shows a high rate of coharboring blaOXA-51, blaOXA-24, and blaIMP-1, which has a direct impact on therapeutic decisions.

28303388,The Impact of Antibiotic Stewardship Programs in Combating Quinolone Resistance: A Systematic Review and Recommendations for More Efficient Interventions.,"Quinolones are among the most commonly prescribed antibiotics worldwide. A clear relationship has been demonstrated between excessive quinolone use and the steady increase in the incidence of quinolone-resistant bacterial pathogens, both in hospital and community sites. In addition, exposure to quinolones has been associated with colonization and infection with healthcare-associated pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile in hospitalized patients. Therefore, the management of quinolone prescribing in hospitals through antibiotic stewardship programs is considered crucial. Although suggestions have been made by previous studies on the positive impact of stewardship programs concerning the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria at hospital level, the association of quinolone-targeted interventions with reduction of quinolone resistance is vague. The purpose of this article was to evaluate the impact of stewardship interventions on quinolone resistance rates and healthcare-associated infections, through a literature review using systematic methods to identify and select the appropriate studies. Recommendations for improvements in quinolone-targeted stewardship programs are also proposed. Efforts in battling quinolone resistance should combine various interventions such as restriction formulary policies, prospective audits with feedback to prescribers, infection prevention and control measures, prompt detection of low-level resistance, educational programs, and guidelines for optimal quinolone usage. However, the effectiveness of such strategies should be assessed by properly designed and conducted clinical trials. Finally, novel approaches in diagnostic stewardship for rapidly detecting bacterial resistance, including PCR-based techniques, mass spectrometry, microarrays, and whole-genome sequencing as well as the prompt investigation on the clonality of quinolone-resistant strains, will strengthen our ability to personalize quinolone prescribing to individual patients.",Advances in therapy,2017,Vasiliki Pitiriga; Georgia Vrioni; George Saroglou; Athanasios Tsakris,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacteriological Techniques', 'Clostridioides difficile', 'Cross Infection', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Humans', 'Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quinolones']","['Antimicrobial stewardship program', 'Feedback', 'Infection control', 'Infectious diseases', 'Preauthorization', 'Prospective audit', 'Quinolones', 'Resistance', 'Restrictive policies']",5
37061101,Diagnostic stewardship in infectious diseases: a continuum of antimicrobial stewardship in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been exacerbated by the inappropriate use of diagnostics, leading to excessive prescription of antimicrobials, and is an imminent threat to global health. Diagnostic stewardship (DS) is an auxiliary to antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) and comprises ordering the right tests, for the right patient, at the right time. It also promotes the judicious use of rapid and novel molecular diagnostic tools to enable the initiation of proper antibiotic therapy, while avoiding excessive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Proper interpretation of test results is crucial to avoid overdiagnosis and excessive healthcare costs. Although many rapid diagnostic tools have been developed with a high diagnostic yield, they are often limited by accessibility, cost, and lack of knowledge regarding their use. Careful consideration of clinical signs and symptoms with knowledge of the local epidemiology are essential for DS. This enables appropriate interpretation of microbiological results. Multidisciplinary teams that include well trained professionals should cooperate to promote DS. Challenges and barriers to the implementation of DS are mostly caused by scarcity of resources and lack of trained personnel and, most importantly, lack of knowledge. The lack of resources is often due to absence of awareness of the impact that good medical microbiology diagnostic facilities and expertise can have on the proper use of antibiotics.",International journal of antimicrobial agents,2023,Johnny Zakhour; Sara F Haddad; Anthony Kerbage; Heiman Wertheim; Pierre Tattevin; Andreas Voss; Serhat Ünal; Abdoul Salam Ouedraogo; Souha S Kanj,"['Humans', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Anti-Infective Agents']","['Antimicrobial resistance', 'Antimicrobial stewardship', 'Diagnostic stewardship', 'Multidisciplinary teams', 'Novel diagnostics in Infectious Diseases']",5

Moreover, information regarding antimicrobial consumption among ICUs in South-East Asia remains scarce and limited. This study aims to determine antibiotics utilization in ICUs by measuring antibiotics consumption over the past six years (2016−2021) and specifically evaluating carbapenems prescribed in a COVID-19 ICU and a general intensive care unit (GICU) during the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. (2) Methods: This is a retrospective cross-sectional observational analysis of antibiotics consumption and carbapenems prescriptions. Antibiotic utilization data were estimated using the WHO Defined Daily Doses (DDD). Carbapenems prescription information was extracted from the audits conducted by ward pharmacists. Patients who were prescribed carbapenems during their admission to COVID-19 ICU and GICU were included. Patients who passed away before being reviewed by the pharmacists were excluded. (3) Results: In general, antibiotics consumption increased markedly in the year 2021 when compared to previous years. Majority of carbapenems were prescribed empirically (86.8%). Comparing COVID-19 ICU and GICU, the reasons for empirical carbapenems therapy in COVID-19 ICU was predominantly for therapy escalation (64.7% COVID-19 ICU vs. 34% GICU, p < 0.001), whereas empirical prescription in GICU was for coverage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) gram-negative bacteria (GNB) (45.3% GICU vs. 22.4% COVID-19 ICU, p = 0.005). Despite microbiological evidence, the empirical carbapenems were continued for a median (interquartile range (IQR)) of seven (5−8) days.

Methods Relevant databases such as Medline, PUBMED, COCHRANE library and EBSCO were searched from 1 April to 27 April 2017. Additional studies were reached by the manual search for original articles in relevant journals. We included all randomized controlled, quasi-experimental and observational studies, published in the English language from 2007 onward, that evaluated effectiveness of ASP in preventing and controlling C. difficile associated disease (CDAD) among adult inpatients. Results Implementation of ASP interventions was associated with CDAD incidence reduction in 62.5% studies, but no significant differences were reported for the duration of hospitalization, readmission and mortality rate. Improvements in prescribing patterns (decreased antimicrobial use or increased rational use) and microbial outcomes (decreased rates of selected antimicrobial-resistant bacteria) were reported. Evidence on the effects of ASP is mainly limited to the results of studies low in methodological quality with great heterogeneity of outcomes, interventions, and units in which CDAD incidence data were reported. Conclusion Despite the low strength of evidence of reviewed studies, consistency of findings suggest the positive impact of antimicrobial stewardship programs on the prevention and control of nosocomial CDAD. The significance of this problem imposes randomized control trial use as the best instrument to provide highquality evidence.

32895246,Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in primary care: narrative review of C reactive protein (CRP) point-of-care testing (POCT) and antibacterial use in patients who present with symptoms of RTI.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) continues to be a global problem and continues to be addressed through national strategies to improve diagnostics, develop new antimicrobials and promote antimicrobial stewardship. Patients who attend general (ambulatory) practice with symptoms of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are invariably assessed by some sort of clinical decision rule (CDR). However, CDRs rely on a cluster of non-specific clinical observations. A narrative review of the literature was undertaken to ascertain the value of C reactive protein (CRP) point-of-care testing (POCT) to guide antibacterial prescribing in adult patients presenting to general practitioner (GP) practices with symptoms of RTI. Studies that were included were Cochrane reviews, systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, cluster randomised trials, controlled before and after studies, cohort studies and economic evaluations. An overwhelming number of studies demonstrated that the use of CRP tests in patients presenting with RTI symptoms reduces index antibacterial prescribing. GPs and patients report a good acceptability for a CRP POCT and economic evaluations show cost-effectiveness of CRP POCT over existing RTI management in primary care. POCTs increase diagnostic precision for GPs in the better management of patients with RTI. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, patients will expect greater precision in diagnosing and managing their illnesses.

Conventional blood cultures, taking 2-5 days for pathogen identification, delay targeted therapy, worsening outcomes, and fueling AMR. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (bioMérieux, USA) offers rapid diagnostics, potentially transforming neonatal sepsis care. This study assesses the diagnostic speed of MALDI-TOF MS versus conventional methods in neonates with suspected sepsis at a North Indian tertiary hospital, alongside bacteriological and AMR profiling. Methodology From November 2022 to November 2023, we prospectively enrolled 100 consecutive outborn neonates (<28 days) with suspected sepsis (positive sepsis screen: ≥2 parameters, e.g., C-reactive protein, leukocyte count) at a tertiary care hospital. Neonates with prior antibiotics, severe asphyxia, or malformations were excluded. Blood samples underwent BacT/Alert culture, with pathogens identified by conventional methods (2-5 days) and MALDI-TOF MS (VITEK MS, bioMérieux, USA).

16813983,Antimicrobial stewardship.,"Antimicrobial stewardship is a key component of a multifaceted approach to preventing emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Good antimicrobial stewardship involves selecting an appropriate drug and optimizing its dose and duration to cure an infection while minimizing toxicity and conditions for selection of resistant bacterial strains. Studies conducted over the years indicate that antibiotic use is unnecessary or inappropriate in as many as 50% of cases in the United States, and this creates unnecessary pressure for the selection of resistant species. Because the pharmaceutical industry pipeline for new antibiotics has been curtailed in recent years, and it may be > or = 10 years before important new antibiotics to treat certain resistant bacteria find their way to market, a premium has been set on maintaining the effectiveness of currently available agents. Several strategies, including prescriber education, formulary restriction, prior approval, streamlining, antibiotic cycling, and computer-assisted programs have been proposed to improve antibiotic use. Although rigorous clinical data in support of these strategies are lacking, the most effective means of improving antimicrobial stewardship will most likely involve a comprehensive program that incorporates multiple strategies and collaboration among various specialties within a given healthcare institution. Computer-assisted software programs may be especially useful in implementing these comprehensive programs. The antimicrobial stewardship program at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, which has been shown to improve appropriateness of antibiotic use and cure rates, decrease failure rates, and reduce healthcare-related costs, is used as an example in support of this multifaceted, multidisciplinary approach. At this time, data from well-controlled studies examining the effect of antibacterial stewardship on emergence of resistance are limited, but available data suggest that good antibiotic stewardship reduces rates of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, resistant gram-negative bacilli, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.",American journal of infection control,2006,Neil Fishman,"['Anti-Infective Agents', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Humans', 'Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",[],5
31139628,Adjunctive Nebulized Antibiotics: What Is Their Place in ICU Infections?,"Inhaled antibiotics have been used as adjunctive therapy for patients with pneumonia, primarily caused by multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens. Most studies have been in ventilated patients, although non-ventilated patients have also been included (but not discussed in this review), and most patients have had nosocomial pneumonia. Aerosolized antibiotics are generally added to systemic therapy, and have shown efficacy, primarily as salvage therapy for failing patients and as adjunctive therapy after an MDR gram-negative has been identified. An advantage to aerosolized antibiotics is that they can achieve high intra-pulmonary concentrations that are potentially effective, even for highly resistant pathogens, and because they are generally not well-absorbed systemically, it is possible to avoid some of the toxicities of systemic therapy. When using inhaled antibiotics, it is essential to choose the appropriate agent and the optimal delivery method. Animal and human studies have shown that aerosolized antibiotics reach higher concentrations in the lung than systemic antibiotics, but that areas of dense pneumonia may not receive as much antibiotic as less affected areas of lung. Optimal delivery in ventilated patients depends on device selection, generally with a preference for vibrating mesh nebulizers and with careful attention to where the device is placed in the ventilator circuit and how the delivery is coordinated with the ventilator cycle. Although some studies have shown a benefit for clinical cure, adjunctive therapy has not led to reduced mortality. In some studies, adjunctive aerosol therapy has reduced the duration of systemic antibiotic therapy, thus serving to promote antimicrobial stewardship. Two recent multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials of adjunctive nebulized antibiotics for VAP patients with suspected MDR gram-negative pneumonia were negative for their primary endpoints. This may have been related to trial design and execution and the lessons learned from these studies need to be incorporated in any future trials. Currently, routine use of adjunctive aerosolized therapy cannot be supported by available data, and this therapy is only recommended to assist in the eradication of highly resistant pathogens and to be used as salvage therapy for patients failing systemic therapy.",Frontiers in medicine,2019,Michael S Niederman,[],"['aerosol therapy', 'antibiotics', 'antimicrobial stewardship', 'clinical trial design', 'multi-drug resistant pathogens', 'nosocomial pneumonia', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia']",5

Data from 14 published clinical studies, meta-analyses and practice guidelines regarding the application of antimicrobial stewardship strategies to the management of CAP were identified and analysed. In the context of CAP, application of stewardship strategies (alone or in combination) has been shown to increase physician awareness of guidelines, improve appropriate antimicrobial use and reduce unnecessary antimicrobial prescribing. In addition, application has had a profound favourable impact on patient outcomes, including decreased 30-day mortality and in-hospital mortality rates, reduced length of hospital stay, reduced treatment failure rates and reduced healthcare costs. Antimicrobial stewardship programmes have been demonstrated to successfully increase the level of appropriate antibiotic prescribing, reduce pathogen resistance and improve clinical outcomes in the management of CAP within hospitals. Studies have also shown that adherence to evidence-based guidelines, even at the level of the individual clinician, can have a profound and positive impact on patient outcomes and healthcare costs.

21679144,How could we reduce antibiotic use in critically ill patients?,"The role of antibiotic pressure in the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is still under debate in the scientific community and often confounded by scarce data on antibiotic usage. Several studies demonstrated that prior antibiotic exposure is likely to increase patient's colonization and infection by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Of even more concern is the significant mortality associated with these infections, in particular in critically ill patients. Therefore, the control of antibiotic usage in intensive care units (ICUs) is of paramount importance. Antibiotic stewardship programmes (ASP) have been demonstrated to represent a useful intervention to reduce the inappropriate antibiotic usage in hospitalized patients. A few trials were performed in ICU population with positive results. The major risk we foresee for the implementation of ASP for ICU patients is the lack of consideration of local ecology and strict quality indicators. The development of new pattern of antimicrobial resistance might be ascribed to an inappropriate ASP.

Several study demonstrated an excessive amount of antibiotic prescribing for communities patients and inpatients and in some hospital up to 50% of antibiotic usage is inappropriate: the benefits of antibiotic treatment come with the risk of antibiotic resistance development. In hospitals, infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria are associated with higher mortality, morbidity and prolonged hospital stay compared with infections caused by antibiotic-susceptible bacteria. A variety of strategies has been proposed to reduce the cost and improve the quality of medication use. Education, guidelines and evidence based recommendations are considered to be essential elements of any program designed to influence prescribing behavior and can provide a foundation of knowledge that will enhance and increase the acceptance of stewardship strategies. Evidence-based recommendations, an approach to clinical practice helping to make decisions based on clinical expertise and on intimate knowledge of the individual patient's situations, beliefs, and priorities, enhance antimicrobial stewardship, that include appropriate selection, dosing, route, and duration of antimicrobial therapy can maximize clinical cure or prevention of infection while limiting the unintended consequences, such as the emergence of resistance, adverse drug events, and cost. These evidence-based guidelines are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and clinical discretion is always required in their application. Genome studies have identified hundreds of genetic polymorphism important determinants of the efficacy of therapy and several trial demonstrated the successful use of pharmacogenomic testing to reduce the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions in patients. Knowing the phenotype of a patient prior to therapy, optimal dose and type drugs can be prescribed to achieve better management of patients.",Minerva pediatrica,2012,G Caramia; E Ruffini,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Cephalexin', 'Chloramphenicol', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Cross Infection', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Genetic Testing', 'Genetic Variation', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Penicillins', 'Pharmacogenetics', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Streptomycin', 'Tetracyclines']",[],5
23801418,Ceftaroline fosamil: a review of its use in the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired pneumonia.,"Ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil (Zinforo, Teflaro), is an advanced-generation, parenteral cephalosporin with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro against Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Gram-negative bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ceftaroline has demonstrated a low potential for the selection of resistance in vitro for drug-resistant Gram-positive organisms, including MRSA, as well as for Gram-negative respiratory pathogens. In pivotal phase III studies, intravenous ceftaroline fosamil demonstrated noninferiority to intravenous vancomycin plus aztreonam in patients hospitalized with complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTIs) and intravenous ceftriaxone in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) risk class III or IV]; however, patients with CAP admitted to the intensive care unit were not evaluated. Ceftaroline fosamil was generally well tolerated in these trials, with an adverse event profile similar to that of other cephalosporins. Diarrhoea was the most commonly reported adverse event; however, the risk of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea with ceftaroline fosamil appeared to be low. Potential limitations of the drug include the lack of an oral formulation and the requirement for twice-daily administration. Nonetheless, ceftaroline fosamil represents an attractive option (either alone or in combination with other agents) for the initial empirical treatment of patients hospitalized with cSSTIs (including those with suspected MRSA infection) or CAP (PORT risk class III or IV) who require intravenous antimicrobial therapy. As with all antibacterial agents, ceftaroline fosamil should be used in accordance with good antimicrobial stewardship.",Drugs,2013,James E Frampton,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Cephalosporins', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Community-Acquired Infections', 'Humans', 'Pneumonia', 'Skin Diseases, Infectious', 'Soft Tissue Infections', 'Ceftaroline']",[],5
40001376,State of the Art of Antimicrobial and Diagnostic Stewardship in Pediatric Setting.,"Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) and diagnostic stewardship programs (DSPs) are essential strategies for effectively managing infectious diseases and tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR). These programs can have a complementary impact, i.e., ASPs optimize antimicrobial use to prevent resistance, while DSPs enhance diagnostic accuracy to guide appropriate treatments. This review explores the current landscape of ASPs and DSPs in pediatric care, focusing on key factors, influencing their development, implementation, and evaluation across various settings. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary, involving multiple healthcare professionals to support comprehensive stewardship practices in pediatric care. No single intervention suits all settings, or even the same setting, in different countries; interventions must be tailored to each specific context, considering factors such as hospital capacity, patient complexity, and the parent-child dynamic. It is essential to educate caregivers on optimal antibiotic use through clear, concise messages adapted to their socioeconomic status and level of understanding. The cost-effectiveness of ASPs and DSPs should also be assessed, and standardized metrics should be employed to evaluate success in pediatric settings, focusing on outcomes beyond just antibiotic consumption, such as AMR rates. This manuscript further discusses emerging opportunities and challenges in ASP implementation, offering insights into future research priorities. These include large-scale studies to evaluate the long-term impact of ASPs, cost-effectiveness assessments of pediatric-specific diagnostic tools, and the integration of artificial intelligence to support clinical decision making. Addressing these areas will enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of ASPs, contributing to global efforts to combat AMR and improve pediatric health outcomes.","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Daniele Donà; Elisa Barbieri; Giulia Brigadoi; Cecilia Liberati; Samantha Bosis; Elio Castagnola; Claudia Colomba; Luisa Galli; Laura Lancella; Andrea Lo Vecchio; Marianna Meschiari; Carlotta Montagnani; Maia De Luca; Stefania Mercadante; Susanna Esposito,[],"['antibiotics', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'antimicrobial stewardship programs', 'pediatric infectious diseases', 'point-of-care tests', 'rapid diagnostic tests']",5
40227352,Management of Carbapenem Resistant Gram-Negative Infections.,"Due to increasing carbapenem usage, resistance to gram negative bacteria is steadily going up in India. Resistance is often enzyme-mediated and transmissible horizontally by plasmids. Use of invasive lines, procedures, prior antibiotic exposure, recent hospitalization, ICU stay, colonization and severity of illness are important risk factors for infections with these bacteria. Before starting therapy, it is important to distinguish colonization from true infection. Early targeted therapy using rapid diagnostic methods is important to ensure optimal outcomes. A growing body of literature recommends the use of novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors over polymyxins in the management of these infections. Treatment strategies for carbapenem resistant Enterobacterales differs from non-Enterobacterales and is discussed in detail in this review.

40049189,Antimicrobials in serious illness and end-of-life care: lifting the veil of silence.,"Global rates of antimicrobial consumption increased by 65% between 2000 and 2015, by 16% between 2016 and 2023, and are estimated to increase by an additional 52% by 2030. Antimicrobial use and misuse remains high among people with serious illness and at end of life, despite scarce evidence of benefit. In addition, the overuse and misuse of antimicrobials at end of life further exacerbate antimicrobial resistance, which is a substantial public and global health concern. This Personal View synthesises global interprofessional and multidisciplinary perspectives on antimicrobial use, stewardship, and resistance at end of life and implications at patient and population levels. Guidelines have been summarised from multiple countries, some of which offer guidance for antimicrobial use at end of life. Countries at different income levels are included (ie, Chile, Colombia, Germany, India, Malaysia, Nigeria, Rwanda, and Sudan) to show how practice norms and standards vary internationally. These examples are combined with a case of non-beneficial end-of-life antimicrobial use and clinical guidance for patient and family communication regarding antimicrobial treatment.

Development of consensus guidelines to standardize these wide variations in care has become a prime objective. The Lebanese Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (LSIDCM) convened to set Lebanese national guidelines for the management of CAP since it is a major and a prevalent disease affecting the Lebanese population. These guidelines, besides being helpful in direct clinical practice, play a major role in establishing stewardship programs in hospitals in an effort to contain antimicrobial resistance on the national level.

23254432,A trial of discontinuation of empiric vancomycin therapy in patients with suspected methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus health care-associated pneumonia.,"Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) guidelines recommend de-escalating initial antibiotic therapy based on results from lower-respiratory-tract cultures. In the absence of adequate lower respiratory cultures, physicians are sometimes reluctant to discontinue empirical vancomycin, which is given for suspected methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) HCAP. We evaluated a strategy of discontinuing vancomycin if both nasal and throat cultures were negative for MRSA when lower-respiratory-tract cultures were not available. An antimicrobial stewardship team identified patients receiving empirical vancomycin for suspected or proven HCAP but for whom adequate lower-respiratory-tract cultures were not available. Nasal and throat swab specimens were obtained and plated on MRSA selective media. If both nasal and throat MRSA cultures were negative, the stewardship team recommended discontinuation of empirical vancomycin. Demographic and clinical aspects, a clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) on the day of the stewardship recommendation, and mortality of patients for whom vancomycin was discontinued were obtained by retrospective chart review. A convenience sample of 91 patients with nasal and throat cultures negative for MRSA in the absence of adequate respiratory cultures had empirical vancomycin therapy discontinued. A retrospective review revealed that 88 (97%) patients had a CPIS of ≤6 on the day of the stewardship recommendation. In-hospital mortality (7.7%) was similar to that of a previous study of de-escalation of antibiotics in pneumonia patients without adequate cultures. In the absence of adequate lower-respiratory-tract cultures, it is reasonable to discontinue empirical vancomycin HCAP therapy in patients with negative MRSA nasal and throat cultures and a CPIS of <6.",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,2013,John M Boyce; Olivia-Fabiola Pop; Odaliz Abreu-Lanfranco; Whitney Y Hung; Ann Fisher; Afshin Karjoo; Benjamin Thompson; Zenon Protopapas,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Cross Infection', 'Culture Media', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasal Cavity', 'Pharynx', 'Pneumonia', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vancomycin']",[],4

The ICU environment, with its high use of invasive devices and immunocompromised patients, fosters an increased risk for multidrug resistance (MDR) pathogens, complicating treatment strategies. Understanding the epidemiology and resistance patterns in these settings is essential for improving patient outcomes and guiding appropriate antimicrobial stewardship practices. This study retrospectively analyzed data from 640 blood culture samples collected in the ICU of the Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University between January 2021 and December 2023. The blood samples were appropriately collected and cultured. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was employed to identify the isolated strains. Antimicrobial sensitivity was assessed using the VITEK2 system, the Epsilometer test (E-test), and the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0. A total of 391 bacterial pathogens (61.1%) were isolated. The predominant pathogens causing BSI were Gram-negative bacteria.

Interpretation of available studies on antibiotic rotation is hampered by heterogeneity in implemented strategies and suboptimal study designs. In this cluster-randomized, crossover trial the effects of two antibiotic rotation strategies, antibiotic mixing and cycling, on the prevalence of ARGNB in ICUs are determined.

40226097,Seasonal variations and the COVID-19 pandemic: impact on antimicrobial stewardship and antibiotic prescribing in a UK secondary care setting to combat antimicrobial resistance-a pilot study.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains a significant global health challenge, exacerbated by inappropriate antibiotic use, particularly during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This pilot study evaluates the impact of seasonal variations and the pandemic on antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) practices in a UK secondary care setting. Using an interrupted time-series analysis, the study examined antibiotic prescribing patterns for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) during the pre-pandemic period of 2019 and the pandemic year of 2020. Among the 80 admissions reviewed, communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) was the most frequent diagnosis, with cases peaking at 15 in December 2019, illustrating the seasonal burden of RTIs. AMS interventions were assessed using the CARES framework, as recommended by the United Kingdom Health Security Agency's (UKHSA) Start Smart, Then Focus toolkit. This CARES framework consists of five key actions: Cease, which involves discontinuing antibiotics if no infection is present; Amend, modifying antibiotic therapy based on clinical response or diagnostic findings; Refer, consulting specialised services when additional expertise is required; Extend, continuing antibiotic therapy with a documented review date; and Switch, transitioning from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy when clinically appropriate. Notable shifts in AMS practices were observed, with Cease interventions increasing from 5% in winter 2019 to 9% by early spring 2020, Amend actions briefly spiking in March 2020, and Switch interventions peaking at 6% in spring 2020, reflecting dynamic stewardship responses to the evolving pandemic landscape. While the small sample size limits statistical power, a more extensive validation sample would strengthen the robustness of the data extraction tool and enhance its credibility for broader applications. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the importance of adaptive, sustainable, and resilient AMS strategies that align with seasonal trends to mitigate AMR risks and ensure effective healthcare delivery during public health emergencies. The study highlights the value of pilot testing in ensuring feasibility and reliability, advocating for the development of robust AMS frameworks to combat AMR and build healthcare resilience during future global crises.",Frontiers in microbiology,2025,Rasha Abdelsalam-Elshenawy; Nkiruka Umaru; Zoe Aslanpour,[],"['COVID-19 pandemic', 'antibiotic prescribing', 'antibiotic stewardship (ABS)', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'antimicrobial stewardship (AMS)', 'antimicrobial stewardship (ASP) intervention', 'hospital', 'seasonal variation']",4

38626111,An agent-based model on antimicrobial de-escalation in intensive care units: Implications on clinical trial design.,"Antimicrobial de-escalation refers to reducing the spectrum of antibiotics used in treating bacterial infections. This strategy is widely recommended in many antimicrobial stewardship programs and is believed to reduce patients' exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics and prevent resistance. However, the ecological benefits of de-escalation have not been universally observed in clinical studies. This paper conducts computer simulations to assess the ecological effects of de-escalation on the resistance prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-a frequent pathogen causing nosocomial infections. Synthetic data produced by the models are then used to estimate the sample size and study period needed to observe the predicted effects in clinical trials. Our results show that de-escalation can reduce colonization and infections caused by bacterial strains resistant to the empiric antibiotic, limit the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and avoid inappropriate empiric therapies. Further, we show that de-escalation could reduce the overall super-infection incidence, and this benefit becomes more evident under good compliance with hand hygiene protocols among health care workers. Finally, we find that any clinical study aiming to observe the essential effects of de-escalation should involve at least ten arms and last for four years-a size never attained in prior studies. This study explains the controversial findings of de-escalation in previous clinical studies and illustrates how mathematical models can inform outcome expectations and guide the design of clinical studies.",PloS one,2024,Xi Huo; Ping Liu,"['Humans', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Pseudomonas Infections', 'Intensive Care Units']",[],4

39907301,Guidelines vs mindlines: a qualitative investigation of how clinicians' beliefs influence the application of rapid molecular diagnostics in intensive care.,"Rapid molecular diagnostic tests improve antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) by facilitating earlier refinement of antimicrobial therapy. The INHALE trial tested the application of the BioFire FilmArray Pneumonia Panel (Pneumonia Panel) for antibiotic prescribing for hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonias (HAP/VAP) in UK intensive care units (ICUs). We report a behavioral study embedded within the INHALE trial examining clinicians' perceptions of using these tests. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 ICU clinicians after using the Pneumonia Panel to manage suspected HAP/VAP. Thematic analysis identified factors reinforcing perceptions of the necessity to modify antibiotic prescribing in accordance with test results and doubts/concerns about doing so. While most acknowledged the importance of AMS, the test's impact on prescribing decisions was limited. Concerns about potential consequences of undertreatment to the patient and prescriber were often more salient than AMS, sometimes leading to ""just-in-case"" antibiotic prescriptions. Test results indicating a broad-spectrum antibiotic were unnecessary often failed to influence clinicians to avoid an initial prescription or de-escalate antibiotics early as they considered their use to be necessary to protect the patient and themselves, ""erring on the side of caution."" Some clinicians described cases where antibiotics would be prescribed for a sick patient regardless of test results because, in their opinion, it fits with the clinical picture-""treating the patient, not the result."" Our findings illustrate a tension between prescribing guidelines and clinicians' ""mindlines,"" characterized by previous experiences. This highlights the need for a ""technology plus"" approach, recognizing the challenges clinicians face when applying technological solutions to patient care.IMPORTANCERapid molecular diagnostic tests for pathogens and resistance genes may improve antibiotic-prescribing decisions and stewardship. However, clinicians' desire to protect their patients with antibiotics often overrides more distal concerns about possible resistance selection, limiting the application of these tests in practice. Findings underscore the challenge of changing prescribing decisions based on technical results or guidelines, highlighting factors such as clinicians' previous experience and ""knowledge in practice"" as more proximal drivers of these decisions. Implementation strategies for technological solutions to antimicrobial resistance must be ""behaviorally intelligent,"" recognizing the challenges facing clinicians when making ""life or death"" prescribing decisions.CLINICAL TRIALSThis study is registered with ISRCTN as ISRCTN16483855.",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,2025,Sarah-Jane F Stewart; Alyssa M Pandolfo; Yogini Jani; Zoe Moon; David Brealey; Virve I Enne; David M Livermore; Vanya Gant; Stephen J Brett; Rob Horne,"['Humans', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Critical Care', 'Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Male', 'Female', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'""]","['antibiotic prescribing', 'intensive care', 'pneumonia', 'rapid molecular diagnostics']",4

Consensus reached from analysis of these data can direct us to the most appropriate controlled trials. While it is accepted that there is a widely held perception that the medical profession has been slow to react to the problem of antibiotic resistance, much more work still needs to be carried out before we can recommend, implement and trial definitive control measures. In the meantime, however, all reasonable efforts should be made to reduce antibiotic consumption without compromising patient care, establish cost-effective surveillance systems using existing laboratory generated data, improve hygiene in our hospitals and better define the molecular basis of antibiotic resistance.",Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,2000,I M Gould; F M MacKenzie; M J Struelens; J M van der Meer,"['Cross Infection', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Utilization', 'Europe', 'Humans', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Professional-to-Patient']",[],4
40445195,Metagenomic sequencing of mpox virus clade Ib lesions identifies possible bacterial and viral co-infections in hospitalized patients in eastern DRC.,"Mpox is an emerging zoonotic disease that caused two public health emergencies of international concern within two years. Less is known about the interplay of microbial organisms in mpox lesions which could result in superinfections that exacerbate outcomes or delay recovery. We utilized a unified metagenomic sequencing approach involving slow-speed centrifugation and differential lysis on 19 mpox lesion swabs of hospitalized patients in South Kivu province (eastern DRC) to characterize bacteria, antimicrobial resistance genes, mpox virus (MPXV), and viral co-infections. High-quality MPXV whole-genome sequences were obtained until a Ct value of 27. Furthermore, co-infections with other clinically relevant viruses, such as varicella zoster virus and herpes simplex virus-2, were detected and confirmed by real-time PCR. In addition, metagenomic sequence analysis of the bacterial content showed the presence of bacteria associated with skin and soft tissue infection in 10 of the 19 samples analyzed. These bacteria had a high abundance of resistance genes, with possible implications for antimicrobial treatment based on the predicted antimicrobial resistance. In conclusion, we report the presence of bacterial and viral pathogens in mpox lesions and detection of widespread resistance genes to the standard antibiotic treatment. The possibility of a co-infection, including antimicrobial resistance, should be considered when discussing treatment options, along with the determination of the case-fatality ratio.IMPORTANCEThe mpox virus clade Ib lineage emerged in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo owing to continuous human-to-human transmission in a vulnerable patient population. A major challenge of this ongoing outbreak is its occurrence in regions with severely limited healthcare infrastructure. As a result, less is known about co-infections in affected patients. Identifying and characterizing pathogens, including their antimicrobial resistance, is crucial for reducing infection-related complications and improving antimicrobial stewardship. In this study, we applied a unified metagenomics approach to detect and characterize bacterial and viral co-infections in mpox lesions of hospitalized mpox patients in the eastern DRC.",Microbiology spectrum,2025,Leonard Schuele; Leandre Murhula Masirika; Hayley Cassidy; Philip T L C Clausen; Luca M Zaeck; Marjan Boter; Pacifique Ndishimye; Jean Claude Udahemuka; Rory D de Vries; Saria Otani; Richard Molenkamp; David F Nieuwenhuijse; Justin Bengehya Mbiribindi; Freddy Belesi Siangoli; Marion Koopmans; Frank M Aarestrup; Bas B Oude Munnink,"['Humans', 'Coinfection', 'Metagenomics', 'Male', 'Female', 'Bacteria', 'Adult', 'Middle Aged', 'Virus Diseases', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Democratic Republic of the Congo', 'Aged', 'Hospitalization', 'Viruses', 'Animals']","['antimicrobial resistance', 'clade Ib', 'co-infections', 'metagenomics', 'monkeypox virus', 'mpox', 'mpox virus']",4
40526640,"Diversity and antibiotic susceptibility profiles of bacterial isolates from wound infections in patients at the surgical unit of Kisii teaching and referral hospital, Kenya.","Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a growing threat to global health, with wound infections serving as significant reservoirs for multidrug-resistant bacteria. Understanding the socio-demographic, clinical, and microbiological characteristics of wound infections is critical for effective intervention strategies in resource-limited settings. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the diversity, bacterial profiles, and resistance patterns of wound infections at Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital. To do this, a total of 118 bacterial isolates from wound swabs were collected from 149 patients who met the eligibility criteria, from May to November 2024. These samples were cultured and analysed using standard microbiological techniques and antibiotic susceptibility testing according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Resistance genes associated with Vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus xylosus were also investigated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with appropriate primers and agarose gel electrophoresis. The results revealed a predominance of male patients (n = 79; 53.02%), avulsions (n = 50; 34.00%), and wounds on lower limbs (n = 63; 42.29%). Escherichia coli (n = 33; 27.97%), Enterobacter gergoviae (n = 20; 16.95%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 18; 15.25%), and Staphylococcus xylosus (n = 18; 15.25%) were the most frequently isolated pathogens. Alarmingly high resistance rates were observed against ACCESS antibiotics, including Cotrimoxazole-Trimethoprim (n = 114; 97%), Ampicillin (n = 109; 92%), and Streptomycin (n = 100; 85%). Resistance to Watch and Reserve antibiotics, including Vancomycin (n = 11; 29%) and Ceftriaxone (n = 27; 33%), was also documented, particularly among Gram-positive isolates such as Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Resistance genes (VanA, VanB, VanC) were detected in S. aureus and S. xylosus, underscoring the role of genetic mechanisms in resistance propagation. These findings highlight the critical need for targeted antimicrobial stewardship programmes and strengthened infection prevention measures in high-burden hospital settings, such as Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital. This study underscores the importance of local resistance data in guiding empirical therapy and informs policies to mitigate AMR in resource-limited contexts. Moreover, enhanced surveillance and research into alternative therapies are crucial to safeguarding the efficacy of life-saving antibiotics and improving patient care outcomes.",PloS one,2025,Samson Onsando; Wycliffe Masanta; Andrew Nyerere; Moses Njire; Gervason Moriasi,"['Humans', 'Male', 'Female', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Kenya', 'Adult', 'Middle Aged', 'Hospitals, Teaching', 'Wound Infection', 'Bacteria', 'Young Adult', 'Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Referral and Consultation']",[],4

The active surveillance of ARB using an integrated one-health approach can help to reduce the emergence and spread of ARB, reduce the associated economic impact, and guide antimicrobial stewardship programs. Wastewater surveillance (WWS) of ARB provides composite samples for a total population, with easy access to the mixed community microbiome. This concept is emerging rapidly, but the clinical utility, sensitivity, and uniformity of WWS of ARB remain poorly understood especially in relation to clinical evidence in sewershed communities. Here, we systematically searched the literature to identify studies that have compared findings from WWS of ARB and antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) with clinical evidence in parallel, thereby evaluating how likely WWS of ARB and ARG can relate to the clinical cases in communities. Initially, 2,235 articles were obtained using the primary search keywords, and 1,219 articles remained after de-duplication. Among these, 35 articles fulfilled the search criteria, and an additional 13 relevant articles were included by searching references in the primary literature. Among the 48 included papers, 34 studies used a culture-based method, followed by 11 metagenomics, and three PCR-based methods. A total of 28 out of 48 included studies were conducted at the single sewershed level, eight studies involved several countries, seven studies were conducted at national or regional scales, and five at hospital levels.

With inappropriate use of antibiotics and rising trends of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extended drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid, it is becoming a public health emergency. This study evaluated the current trends in antibiotic susceptibilities to Salmonella (S) typhi and paratyphi A, B, and C in southern Pakistan. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study, conducted in the Pediatrics Department, Civil Hospital, Jamshoro from July to December 2018, included children with S. typhi and S. paratyphi A and B strains isolated from the laboratory-based culture of blood samples. Results There were 223 (81.1%) children with S. typhi and 52 (18.9%) with S. paratyphi isolates. Their mean age was 5 ± 3 years. The most common age group with S. typhi strains was two to five years (n = 102; 37.1%). Previous trials of antibiotics were taken by 162 (58.9%) children; 65 (40.1%) of these were physician-prescribed. Cefixime was most commonly taken (66.6%), followed by ciprofloxacin (33.3%). Cefixime and ceftriaxone showed 60.9% and 65.8% sensitivity, respectively. Ciprofloxacin sensitivity was seen in 50.1% S. typhi isolates. There were six (2.6%) cases of MDR typhoid and two (0.9%) cases of XDR typhoid. Conclusion Resistance to second-line antityphoid agents is increasing. Therefore, there is a need to modify prescribing behavior. The outbreak of XDR typhoid among children is an alarming public health concern for Pakistan.

30639629,Fluoroquinolone-based versus β-lactam-based regimens for complicated intra-abdominal infections: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.,"Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) are common and confer significant morbidity, mortality and costs. In this era of evolving antimicrobial resistance, selection of appropriate empirical antimicrobials is paramount. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials compared the effectiveness and safety of fluoroquinolone (FQ)-based versus β-lactam (BL)-based regimens for the treatment of patients with cIAIs. Primary outcomes were treatment success in the clinically evaluable (CE) population and all-cause mortality in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Subgroup analyses were performed based on specific antimicrobials, infection source and isolated pathogens. Seven trials (4125 patients) were included. FQ-based regimens included moxifloxacin (four studies) or ciprofloxacin/metronidazole (three studies); BL-based regimens were ceftriaxone/metronidazole (three studies), carbapenems (two studies) or piperacillin/tazobactam (two studies). There was no difference in effectiveness in the CE (2883 patients; RR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.95-1.04) or ITT populations (3055 patients; RR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.94-1.01).

Several methods are available for performing AST including broth microdilution, agar dilution, and disk diffusion. Technological advances such as the development of commercial automated susceptibility testing platforms and the advent of rapid diagnostic tests have improved the rapidity, robustness, and clinical application of AST. Numerous accrediting and regulatory agencies are involved in the process of AST and setting and revising breakpoints, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Challenges to optimizing AST include the emergence of new resistance mechanisms, the development of new antimicrobial agents, and generation of new data requiring updates and revisions to established methods and breakpoints. Together, the challenges in AST methods and their interpretation create important opportunities for well-informed clinicians to improve patient outcomes and provide value to antimicrobial stewardship programs, especially in the setting of rapidly changing and increasing AMR. Addressing AST challenges will involve continued development of new technologies along with collaboration between clinicians and the laboratory to facilitate optimal antimicrobial use, combat the increasing burden of AMR, and inform the development of novel antimicrobials.

27385708,Antimicrobial Stewardship in the Microbiology Laboratory: Impact of Selective Susceptibility Reporting on Ciprofloxacin Utilization and Susceptibility of Gram-Negative Isolates to Ciprofloxacin in a Hospital Setting.,"The objective of this study was to determine the impact of selective susceptibility reporting on ciprofloxacin utilization and Gram-negative susceptibility to ciprofloxacin in a hospital setting. Historically at our institution, the microbiology laboratory practice was to report ciprofloxacin susceptibility for all Enterobacteriaceae regardless of susceptibility to other agents. A selective reporting policy was implemented which involved the suppression of ciprofloxacin susceptibility to Enterobacteriaceae when there was lack of resistance to the antibiotics on the Gram-negative panel. Ciprofloxacin utilization (measured in defined daily doses [DDD] per 1,000 patient days) was collected before and after the intervention and compared to moxifloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. Monthly susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli to ciprofloxacin was tabulated. An interrupted time series analysis using segmented regression was performed. The mean monthly ciprofloxacin utilization decreased from 87 (95% CI, 83.7 to 91.2) to 39 (95% CI, 35.0 to 44.0) DDD per 1,000 patient days before and after the implementation of selective reporting, respectively. There was an immediate and sustained reduction in ciprofloxacin usage at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postintervention (P < 0.001). A compensatory increase in amoxicillin-clavulanate use was noted starting at 6 months postintervention and persisted for the study period (P < 0.027). Susceptibility of E. coli, but not that of P. aeruginosa, to ciprofloxacin was higher than predicted starting 12 months after the intervention (P < 0.05). In conclusion, selective reporting of ciprofloxacin susceptibly may be a useful intervention to reduce targeted antimicrobial utilization and improve Gram-negative susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. This approach should be considered as part of a broader multimodal antimicrobial stewardship program.",Journal of clinical microbiology,2016,B J Langford; J Seah; A Chan; M Downing; J Johnstone; L M Matukas,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Drug Utilization', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Interrupted Time Series Analysis', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests']",[],4

Existing studies have demonstrated a clinical utility with this assay when antibiotic stewardship programs assist clinicians with interpreting the results. However, the benefit of these rapid assays in the absence of concomitant antibiotic stewardship involvement is unclear. In this randomized study of 220 patients with enterococcal or streptococcal bacteremia, we found that PNA FISH, in the absence of concomitant input from an antibiotic stewardship program, had no impact on time to effective or optimal therapy, length of hospital stay, or in-hospital mortality.

36556490,Resistance to Some New Drugs and Prevalence of ESBL- and MBL-Producing Enterobacteriaceae Uropathogens Isolated from Diabetic Patients.,"Diabetes is a leading non-communicable disease and a risk factor for relapsing infections. The current study was aimed at investigating the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of carbapenem-resistant (CR) uropathogens of the family Enterobacteriaceae in diabetic patients. The data of 910 bacterial isolates was collected from diagnostic laboratories during January 2018 to December 2018. The bacterial isolates were identified using traditional methods including colonial characteristics, biochemical tests, and API (20E). Antimicrobial susceptibility and phenotypic characterization of ESBL, MBLs, and KPC was determined by utilizing CLSI recommended methods. The phenotypically positive isolates were further analyzed for resistance-encoding genes by manual PCR and Check-MDR CT103XL microarray. Susceptibility to colistin and cefiderocol was tested in accordance with CLSI guidelines. The data revealed that most of the patients were suffering from type 2 diabetes for a duration of more than a year and with uncontrolled blood sugar levels. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most frequently encountered pathogens, followed by Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis. More than 50% of the isolates showed resistance to 22 antibiotics, with the highest resistance (>80%) against tetracycline, ampicillin, and cefazolin. The uropathogens showed less resistance to non-β-lactam antibiotics, including amikacin, fosfomycin, and nitrofurantoin. In the phenotypic assays, 495 (54.3%) isolates were found to be ESBL producers, while ESBL-TEM and -PER were the most prevalent ESBL types. The resistance to carbapenems was slightly less (250; 27.5%) than ESBL producers, yet more common amongst E. coli isolates. MBL production was a common feature in carbapenem-resistant isolates (71.2%); genotypic characterization also validated this trend. The isolates were found to be sensitive against the new drugs, cefiderocol and eravacycline. with 7−28% resistance, except for P. mirabilis which had 100% resistance against eravacycline. This study concludes that a few types of ESBL and carbapenemases are common in the uropathogens isolated from the diabetic patients, and antibiotic stewardship programs need to be revisited, particularly to cure UTIs in diabetic patients.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Othman M Alzahrani; Fakhur Uddin; Samy F Mahmoud; Amal S Alswat; Muhammad Sohail; Mona Youssef,[],"['E. coli', 'K. pneumoniae', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'type 2 diabetes', 'β-lactamase']",4

38141837,The changes of different restriction level adjustments on antibiotic use in China.,"This quasi-experimental study aimed to investigate the changes in antibiotic use tailored by adjusting provincial antibiotic restriction lists in China using interrupted time-series analysis from 2013 to 2019. Antibiotic use was assessed as defined daily dose (DDD) per 1000 patients per day. Trends and level changes were analysed with segmented regression. The study identified 19 antibiotic formulations in four provinces with adjusted restriction levels (intervention group) and 110 formulations in the rest provinces without adjustments (comparison group). Antibiotics restriction level changed between two categories: (1) between 'highly-restricted' and 'restricted' and (2) between 'restricted' and 'non-restricted'. Analysis revealed distinct trend changes for antibiotics moving between 'highly-restricted' and 'restricted' (β = 0.0211, P = 0.003) and 'restricted' to 'highly-restricted' (β = -0.0039, P = 0.128) compared to the comparison group.

38411087,Evaluation of an automated feedback intervention to improve antibiotic prescribing among primary care physicians (OPEN Stewardship): a multinational controlled interrupted time-series study.,"Tools to advance antimicrobial stewardship in the primary health care setting, where most antimicrobials are prescribed, are urgently needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate OPEN Stewarship (Online Platform for Expanding aNtibiotic Stewardship), an automated feedback intervention, among a cohort of primary care physicians. We performed a controlled, interrupted time-series study of 32 intervention and 725 control participants, consisting of primary care physicians from Ontario, Canada and Southern Israel, from October 2020 to December 2021. Intervention participants received three personalized feedback reports targeting several aspects of antibiotic prescribing. Study outcomes (overall prescribing rate, prescribing rate for viral respiratory conditions, prescribing rate for acute sinusitis, and mean duration of therapy) were evaluated using multilevel regression models. We observed a decrease in the mean duration of antibiotic therapy (IRR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.99) in intervention participants during the intervention period. We did not observe a significant decline in overall antibiotic prescribing (OR = 1.01; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.07), prescribing for viral respiratory conditions (OR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.03), or prescribing for acute sinusitis (OR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.07). In this antimicrobial stewardship intervention among primary care physicians, we observed shorter durations of therapy per antibiotic prescription during the intervention period. The COVID-19 pandemic may have hampered recruitment; a dramatic reduction in antibiotic prescribing rates in the months before our intervention may have made physicians less amenable to further reductions in prescribing, limiting the generalizability of the estimates obtained.IMPORTANCEAntibiotic overprescribing contributes to antibiotic resistance, a major threat to our ability to treat infections. We developed the OPEN Stewardship (Online Platform for Expanding aNtibiotic Stewardship) platform to provide automated feedback on antibiotic prescribing in primary care, where most antibiotics for human use are prescribed but where the resources to improve antibiotic prescribing are limited. We evaluated the platform among a cohort of primary care physicians from Ontario, Canada and Southern Israel from October 2020 to December 2021. The results showed that physicians who received personalized feedback reports prescribed shorter courses of antibiotics compared to controls, although they did not write fewer antibiotic prescriptions.

29514274,Treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria: report of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy/Healthcare Infection Society/British Infection Association Joint Working Party.,"The Working Party makes more than 100 tabulated recommendations in antimicrobial prescribing for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) and suggest further research, and algorithms for hospital and community antimicrobial usage in urinary infection. The international definition of MDR is complex, unsatisfactory and hinders the setting and monitoring of improvement programmes. We give a new definition of multiresistance. The background information on the mechanisms, global spread and UK prevalence of antibiotic prescribing and resistance has been systematically reviewed. The treatment options available in hospitals using intravenous antibiotics and in primary care using oral agents have been reviewed, ending with a consideration of antibiotic stewardship and recommendations. The guidance has been derived from current peer-reviewed publications and expert opinion with open consultation. Methods for systematic review were NICE compliant and in accordance with the SIGN 50 Handbook; critical appraisal was applied using AGREE II. Published guidelines were used as part of the evidence base and to support expert consensus. The guidance includes recommendations for stakeholders (including prescribers) and antibiotic-specific recommendations. The clinical efficacy of different agents is critically reviewed. We found there are very few good-quality comparative randomized clinical trials to support treatment regimens, particularly for licensed older agents. Susceptibility testing of MDR GNB causing infection to guide treatment needs critical enhancements. Meropenem- or imipenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae should have their carbapenem MICs tested urgently, and any carbapenemase class should be identified: mandatory reporting of these isolates from all anatomical sites and specimens would improve risk assessments. Broth microdilution methods should be adopted for colistin susceptibility testing. Antimicrobial stewardship programmes should be instituted in all care settings, based on resistance rates and audit of compliance with guidelines, but should be augmented by improved surveillance of outcome in Gram-negative bacteraemia, and feedback to prescribers. Local and national surveillance of antibiotic use, resistance and outcomes should be supported and antibiotic prescribing guidelines should be informed by these data. The diagnosis and treatment of both presumptive and confirmed cases of infection by GNB should be improved. This guidance, with infection control to arrest increases in MDR, should be used to improve the outcome of infections with such strains.

34943679,Newborns with Bloody Stools-At the Crossroad between Efficient Management of Necrotizing Enterocolitis and Antibiotic Stewardship.,"The onset of bloody stools in neonates often results in antibiotic treatment for suspected necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) is an often-neglected differential diagnosis. We performed a retrospective analysis of antibiotic exposure at our tertiary center from 2011 to 2020 that included three time periods of differing antimicrobial stewardship goals. We compared these data with the conventional treatment guidelines (modified Bell's criteria). In our cohort of 102 neonates with bloody stools, the length of antibiotic exposure was significantly reduced from a median of 4 to 2 days. The proportion of treated neonates decreased from 100% to 55% without an increase in negative outcomes. There were 434 antibiotic days. Following a management strategy according to modified Bell's criteria would have led to at least 780 antibiotic days. The delayed initiation of antibiotic treatment was observed in 7 of 102 cases (6.9%). No proven NEC case was missed. Mortality was 3.9%. In conclusion, with FPIAP as a differential diagnosis of NEC, an observational management strategy in neonates with bloody stools that present in a good clinical condition seems to be justified. This may lead to a significant reduction of antibiotic exposure. Further prospective, randomized trials are needed to prove the safety of this observational approach.","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Marie Heyne-Pietschmann; Dirk Lehnick; Johannes Spalinger; Franziska Righini-Grunder; Michael Buettcher; Markus Lehner; Martin Stocker,[],"['antibiotic exposure', 'antibiotic stewardship', 'food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis', 'necrotizing enterocolitis', 'neonates']",4

35307800,Medication and Fluid Management of Pediatric Sepsis and Septic Shock.,"Sepsis is a life-threatening response to infection that contributes significantly to neonatal and pediatric morbidity and mortality worldwide. The key tenets of care include early recognition of potential sepsis, rapid intervention with appropriate fluids to restore adequate tissue perfusion, and empiric antibiotics to cover likely pathogens. Vasoactive/inotropic agents are recommended if tissue perfusion and hemodynamics are inadequate following initial fluid resuscitation. Several adjunctive therapies have been suggested with theoretical benefit, though definitive recommendations are not yet supported by research reports. This review focuses on the recommendations for medication and fluid management of pediatric sepsis and septic shock, highlighting issues related to antibiotic choices and antimicrobial stewardship, selection of intravenous fluids for resuscitation, and selection and use of vasoactive/inotropic medications. Controversy remains regarding resuscitation fluid volume and type, antibiotic choices depending upon infectious risks in the patient's community, and adjunctive therapies such as vitamin C, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and methylene blue. We include best practice recommendations based on international guidelines, a review of primary literature, and a discussion of ongoing clinical trials and the nuances of therapeutic choices.",Paediatric drugs,2022,Lauren Burgunder; Caroline Heyrend; Jared Olson; Chanelle Stidham; Roni D Lane; Jennifer K Workman; Gitte Y Larsen,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Child', 'Fluid Therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Resuscitation', 'Sepsis', 'Shock, Septic']",[],4

36289096,Evaluation of antibiotic stewardship among near-term and term infants admitted to a neonatal unit.,"To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of evidence-based antibiotic stewardship in a neonatal unit in China. The study period consisted of two phases, one retrospective (the baseline period, January to December 2018, and the transition period, January 2019 to August 2020) and one prospective intervention period (September 2020 to August 2021). During the prospective period, evidence-based antibiotic stewardship was applied to neonates with suspected infections, pneumonia, and culture-negative sepsis. The antibiotic stewardship included the observation form of neonatal infections, antibiotic therapy of no more than 48 h for suspected infections, and 5 days for pneumonia and culture-negative sepsis. The change in antibiotic use measured by days of therapy per 1000 patient-days between the baseline and intervention period was analyzed. Safety outcomes included reinitiation of antibiotics within 14 days, length of stay, occurrence of late-onset sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis (Bell stage ≥ II), multidrug-resistant organism infections, and mortality. A total of 7705 neonates were enrolled during the baseline (n = 4804) and the intervention periods (n = 2901). The total antibiotic usage during the baseline period was 771 days of therapy per 1000 patient-days, while that was 525 days of therapy per 1000 patient-days during the intervention period, indicating a 32% decrease in antibiotic consumption. No significant difference in safety outcomes was observed between the baseline and intervention period (P > 0.05), whereas the length of stay was longer during the intervention period (P < 0.001).",European journal of pediatrics,2023,Kun Feng; Yunyan He; Weiqin Liu; Xinyin Zhang; Ping Song; Ziyu Hua,"['Infant, Newborn', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Enterocolitis, Necrotizing', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Sepsis', 'Neonatal Sepsis']","['Antibiotic stewardship', 'Interrupted time series analysis', 'Neonate', 'Quality improvement']",4
35588970,Effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programmes based on rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing of haematological patients having high-risk factors for bacteraemia-related mortality: a post-hoc analysis of a randomised controlled trial.,"A randomised controlled trial showed that rapid phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) with antimicrobial stewardship programme (ASP) increases the proportion of haematological patients with bacteraemia receiving optimal targeted therapy within 72 h of blood culture collection. This post-hoc analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of rapid phenotypic AST intervention in haematological patients at high risk of a poor outcome from bacteraemia. Haematological patients with bacteraemia (n = 116) were assigned randomly to a conventional AST group or a rapid AST group. The two outcome measures were the proportion of patients receiving optimal targeted therapy at 72 h post blood culture collection and the time to optimal targeted therapy; subgroup analysis was conducted based on baseline demographics (age, sex) and prognostic (Charlson comorbidity index, haematological treatment intensity, Pitt bacteraemia score, appropriateness of empirical antibiotic therapy and multidrug-resistant organism) indicators. The interaction effect between the intervention and subgroup factors was examined using regression model analysis. Age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, haematological treatment intensity, Pitt bacteraemia score and appropriateness of empirical antibiotic therapy had no significant interaction effects on the proportion of patients receiving optimal targeted therapy (P = 0.129-0.826). However, infection by a multidrug-resistant organism did have a significant interaction effect (P = 0.042). Regarding time to optimal targeted therapy, there were no significant interaction effects between the intervention and subgroup factors (P = 0.156-0.848). In conclusion, rapid phenotypic AST with ASP intervention may accelerate early optimal targeted antimicrobial treatment of haematological patients, even those in high-risk subgroups with bacteraemia.",International journal of antimicrobial agents,2022,Jeong-Han Kim; Taek Soo Kim; Euijin Chang; Chang Kyung Kang; Pyoeng Gyun Choe; Nam Joong Kim; Myoung-Don Oh; Wan Beom Park; Inho Kim,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Bacteremia', 'Blood Culture', 'Enterococcus', 'Humans', 'Risk Factors']","['Antibiotic susceptibility testing', 'Antimicrobial stewardship programme', 'Bacteraemia', 'High-risk haematological patient', 'Rapid diagnostic test']",4

The study aimed to explore effective interventions in improving antimicrobial use in hospitals. Literature was systemically searched for interventional studies through PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus databases that were published in the period between January 2010 to April 2022. A random-effects model was used to pool and evaluate data from eligible studies that reported antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) interventions in outpatient and inpatient settings. Pooled estimates presented as proportions and standardized mean differences. Forty-eight articles were included in this review: 32 in inpatient and 16 in outpatient settings. Seventeen interventions have been identified, and eight outcomes have been targeted. AMS interventions improved clinical, microbiological, and cost outcomes in most studies. When comparing non-intervention with intervention groups using meta-analysis, there was an insignificant reduction in length of stay (MD: -0.99; 95% CI: -2.38, 0.39) and a significant reduction in antibiotics' days of therapy (MD: -2.73; 95% CI: -3.92, -1.54). There were noticeable reductions in readmissions, mortality rates, and antibiotic prescriptions post antimicrobial stewardship multi-disciplinary team (AMS-MDT) interventions.

36297149,Global Prevalence of Colistin Resistance in ,"Background: Among gram-negative bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the most common causes of healthcare-related infection. Bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae are notorious for being difficult to treat due to resistance to commonly used antimicrobials. Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from bloodstream infections are becoming increasingly resistant to carbapenems. In the fight against carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, colistin [polymyxin E] is the antimicrobial of choice and is thus widely used. Objective: This study aimed to determine the global prevalence of colistin resistance amongst Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from bloodstream infections. Methods: PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library were searched for published articles without restricting the search period. Studies meeting the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria were included, and quality was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist. We used a statistical random effect model to analyze data with substantial heterogeneity (I2 > 50%) in the meta-analysis. Results: A total of 10 studies out of 2873 search results that met the inclusion criteria were included in the final synthesis for this study. A pooled prevalence of colistin resistance was 3.1%, 95% CI (1.5−4.7%). The highest colistin resistance pooled prevalence was recorded in isolates studied in 2020 and beyond 12.90% (4/31), while Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates studied in 2015 and before and in 2016−2019 showed a pooled colistin resistance rate of 2.89% (48/1661) and 2.95% (28/948), respectively. The highest colistin resistance was found in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from Thailand (19.2%), while the least pooled resistance was in Klebsiella pneumoniae from South Korea (0.8%). The pooled prevalence of the multidrug-resistant (MDR) of Klebsiella pneumoniae from bloodstream infection ranged from 80.1%, 95% CI (65.0−95.2%), and the resistance prevalence of other antibiotics by Klebsiella pneumoniae from bloodstream infections were as follows; ciprofloxacin (45.3%), ertapenem (44.4%), meropenem (36.1%), imipenem (35.2%), gentamicin (33.3%), amikacin (25.4%) and tigecycline (5.1%). Klebsiella pneumoniae recovered from the intensive care unit (ICU) showed higher colistin resistance, 11.5% (9/781%), while non-ICU patients showed 3.03% (80/2604) pooled colistin resistance. Conclusion: This study showed low colistin resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from global bloodstream infections. However, significant colistin resistance was observed in isolates collected from 2020 and beyond. Significant colistin resistance was also observed in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates in bloodstream infections from the intensive care unit (ICU) compared to those from non-ICUs. As a result, there is a need to institute colistin administration stewardship in the ICU in clinical settings.","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Leonard Ighodalo Uzairue; Ali A Rabaan; Fumilayo Ajoke Adewumi; Obiageli Jovita Okolie; Jamiu Bello Folorunso; Muhammed A Bakhrebah; Mohammed Garout; Wadha A Alfouzan; Muhammad A Halwani; Aref A Alamri; Shaima A Halawani; Fatimah S Alshahrani; Abdulkarim Hasan; Abbas Al Mutair; Saad Alhumaid; Johnson Etafo; Idorenyin Utip; Ikenna Maximillian Odoh; Nkolika S Uwaezuoke,[],"['Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'bloodstream infection', 'colistin-resistance', 'multi-drug resistance', 'prevalence']",4
36453810,An algorithm for PCT-guided antimicrobial therapy: a consensus statement by Japanese experts.,"In Japan, a national antimicrobial resistance (AMR) action plan was adopted in 2016, advocating a 20% reduction in antibiotic consumption by 2020. However, there is still room for improvement to accomplish this goal. Many randomized controlled trials have reported that procalcitonin (PCT)-guided antimicrobial therapy could help to reduce antibiotic consumption without negative health effects, specifically in acute respiratory infections. In September 2018, some experts in Europe and the USA proposed algorithms for PCT-guided antimicrobial therapy in mild to moderate infection cases outside the ICU and severe cases in the ICU (the international experts consensus). Thereafter, a group of Japanese experts, including specialists in intensive care medicine, emergency medicine, respiratory medicine and infectious diseases, created a modified version of a PCT-guided algorithm (Japanese experts consensus). This modified algorithm was adapted to better fit Japanese medical circumstances, since PCT-guided therapy is not widely used in daily clinical practice in Japan. The Japanese algorithm has three specific characteristics. First, the target patients are limited to only hospitalized ICU or non-ICU patients.

34733507,Prevention and management of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in haematopoietic cell transplantation.,"Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients. Factors like mucositis, neutropenia, prolonged hospital stay, and frequent use of prophylactic antimicrobials make HCT recipients especially susceptible to CRE infections. Low culture positivity rates, delay in microbiological diagnosis, and resistance to empirical antimicrobial therapy for febrile neutropenia are responsible for high mortality rates in HCT recipients infected with CRE. In this review we discuss the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of CRE infections with particular emphasis on patients undergoing HCT. We emphasise the need for preventive strategies like multidisciplinary antimicrobial stewardship, and pre-emptive screening for CRE colonisation in prospective HCT patients as measures to mitigate the adverse impact of CRE on HCT outcomes. Newer diagnostic tests like polymerase chain reaction and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) assay that enable earlier and better identification of CRE isolates are discussed. Antimicrobial agents available against CRE, including newer agents like ceftazidime-avibactam and meropenem-vaborbactam, have been reviewed. We also discuss the data on promising experimental treatments against CRE: phage therapy and healthy donor faecal microbiota transplant.

35013613,Direct antimicrobial resistance prediction from clinical MALDI-TOF mass spectra using machine learning.,"Early use of effective antimicrobial treatments is critical for the outcome of infections and the prevention of treatment resistance. Antimicrobial resistance testing enables the selection of optimal antibiotic treatments, but current culture-based techniques can take up to 72 hours to generate results. We have developed a novel machine learning approach to predict antimicrobial resistance directly from matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra profiles of clinical isolates. We trained calibrated classifiers on a newly created publicly available database of mass spectra profiles from the clinically most relevant isolates with linked antimicrobial susceptibility phenotypes. This dataset combines more than 300,000 mass spectra with more than 750,000 antimicrobial resistance phenotypes from four medical institutions. Validation on a panel of clinically important pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, resulting in areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80, 0.74 and 0.74, respectively, demonstrated the potential of using machine learning to substantially accelerate antimicrobial resistance determination and change of clinical management. Furthermore, a retrospective clinical case study of 63 patients found that implementing this approach would have changed the clinical treatment in nine cases, which would have been beneficial in eight cases (89%). MALDI-TOF mass spectra-based machine learning may thus be an important new tool for treatment optimization and antibiotic stewardship.",Nature medicine,2022,Caroline Weis; Aline Cuénod; Bastian Rieck; Olivier Dubuis; Susanne Graf; Claudia Lang; Michael Oberle; Maximilian Brackmann; Kirstine K Søgaard; Michael Osthoff; Karsten Borgwardt; Adrian Egli,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Escherichia coli', 'Humans', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staphylococcus aureus']",[],4
28745260,Implementation of an Antimicrobial Stewardship Program in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate antimicrobial utilization and prescription practices in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) after implementation of an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP). DESIGN Quasi-experimental, interrupted time-series study. SETTING A 54-bed, level IV NICU in a regional academic and tertiary referral center. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS All neonates prescribed antimicrobials from January 1, 2011, to June 30, 2016, were eligible for inclusion. INTERVENTION Implementation of a NICU-specific ASP beginning July 2012. METHODS We convened a multidisciplinary team and developed guidelines for common infections, with a focus on prescriber audit and feedback. We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis to evaluate the effects of our ASP. Our primary outcome measure was days of antibiotic therapy (DOT) per 1,000 patient days for all and for select antimicrobials. Secondary outcomes included provider-specific antimicrobial prescription events for suspected late-onset sepsis (blood or cerebrospinal fluid infection at >72 hours of life) and guideline compliance. RESULTS Antibiotic utilization decreased by 14.7 DOT per 1,000 patient days during the stewardship period, although this decrease was not statistically significant (P=.669). Use of ampicillin, the most commonly antimicrobial prescribed in our NICU, decreased significantly, declining by 22.5 DOT per 1,000 patient days (P=.037). Late-onset sepsis evaluation and prescription events per 100 NICU days of clinical service decreased significantly (P<.0001), with an average reduction of 2.65 evaluations per year per provider. Clinical guidelines were adhered to 98.75% of the time. CONCLUSIONS Implementation of a NICU-specific antimicrobial stewardship program is feasible and can improve antibiotic prescribing practices.

35172360,Microbiology Assessments in Critically Ill Patients.,"The prevalence of suspected or proven infections in critically ill patients is high, with a substantial attributable risk to in-hospital mortality. Coordinated guidance and interventions to improve the appropriate microbiological assessment for diagnostic and therapeutic decisions are therefore pivotal. Conventional microbiology follows the paradigm of ""best practice"" of specimen selection and collection, governed by laboratory processing and standard operating procedures, and informed by the latest developments and trends. In this regard, the preanalytical phase of a microbiological diagnosis is crucial since inadequate sampling may result in the incorrect diagnosis and inappropriate management. In addition, the isolation and detection of contaminants interfere with multiple intensive care unit (ICU) processes, which confound the therapeutic approach to critically ill patients. To facilitate bedside enablement, the microbiology laboratory should provide expedited feedback, reporting, and interpretation of results. Compared with conventional microbiology, novel rapid and panel-based diagnostic strategies have the clear advantages of a rapid turnaround time, the detection of many microorganisms including antimicrobial resistant determinants and thus promise substantial improvements in health care. However, robust data on the clinical evaluation of rapid diagnostic tests in presumed sepsis, sepsis and shock are extremely limited and more rigorous intervention studies, focusing on direct benefits for critically ill patients, are pivotal before widespread adoption of their use through the continuum of ICU stay. Advocating the use of these diagnostics without firmly establishing which patients would benefit most, how to interpret the results, and how to treat according to the results obtained, could in fact be counterproductive with regards to diagnostic ""best practice"" and antimicrobial stewardship. Thus, for the present, they may supplement but not yet supplant conventional microbiological assessments.",Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,2022,Adrian John Brink; Chad M Centner; Stefan Opperman,"['Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Critical Illness', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Sepsis']",[],4

35077523,Effects of infectious disease consultation and antimicrobial stewardship program at a Japanese cancer center: An interrupted time-series analysis.,"In cancer patients, appropriate diagnosis and management of infection are frequently challenging owing to subtle or atypical presentation. We investigated the effectiveness of infectious disease (ID) consultations and the Antimicrobial Stewardship Program (ASP) in a Japanese cancer center. This 36-month-period, single-institution, interrupted time series analysis was retrospectively conducted during April 1, 2018-March 31, 2021, to evaluate a two-phase intervention: Phase 1 (notification of antimicrobials by the infection control team) and Phase 2 (establishing an ID consultation service and implementing ASP). Among 32,202 patients hospitalized, 22,096 and 10,106 hospitalizations occurred at baseline and during intervention period, respectively. The Antimicrobial Stewardship Team (AST) provided feedback on specific broad-spectrum antimicrobials in 913 instances (347 appropriate [38%]; 566 inappropriate [62%]), and 440 ID consultations were completed, with a 75% overall acceptance rate for AST suggestions. In Phase 2, monthly carbapenem days of therapy (CAR-DOT) decreased significantly, and narrow-spectrum antibiotic usage increased significantly in both trend and level; monthly DOT of antipseudomonal agents decreased significantly in trend. The results of these analyses of antimicrobial use are consistent with the DOT-based data based on antimicrobial use density (AUD). The total number of inpatient specimens increased significantly; the trend of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections decreased, without changes in the incidence of other resistant organisms, all-cause in-hospital mortality, and length of stay. Actual and adjusted CAR purchase costs per patient-day decreased without significant changes in the actual and adjusted purchase cost per patient-day for all intravenous antimicrobials. Combining ID consultation and ASP reduced carbapenem use without negative patient outcomes. Their implementation could facilitate establishment of safe cancer treatment facilities in Japan and improve prognosis in cancer patients.",PloS one,2022,Naoya Itoh; Nana Akazawa; Eri Kanawaku; Hiromi Murakami; Yuichi Ishibana; Daichi Kawamura; Takanori Kawabata; Keita Mori; Eiichi N Kodama; Norio Ohmagari,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Cancer Care Facilities', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms', 'Pseudomonas Infections', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Staphylococcal Infections']",[],4

Hospitalized adult patients with blood culture pathogens on a rapid, multiplex PCR-based blood culture identification panel (BCID) that included 19 bacterial species, 5 Candida spp., and 4 antimicrobial resistance genes were studied over sequential time periods in a pre-post quasiexperimental study in 3 groups in the following categories: conventional organism identification (controls), conventional organism identification with ASP (AS), and BCID with ASP (BCID). Clinical and economic outcomes were compared between groups. There were 783 patients with positive blood cultures; of those patients, 364 (115 control, 104 AS, and 145 BCID) met inclusion criteria. The time from blood culture collection to organism identification was shorter in the BCID group (17 h; P < 0.001) than in the control group (57 h) or the AS group (54 h). The BCID group had a shorter time to effective therapy (5 h; P < 0.001) than the control group (15 h) or AS group (13 h). The AS (57%) and BCID (52%) groups had higher rates of antimicrobial de-escalation than the control group (34%), with de-escalation occurring sooner in the BCID group (48 h; P = 0.034) than in the AS group (61 h) or the control group (63 h). No difference between the control group, AS group, and BCID group was seen with respect to mortality, 30-day readmission, intensive care unit length of stay (LOS), postculture LOS, or costs. In patients with BSI, ASP alone improved antimicrobial utilization. Addition of BCID to an established ASP shortened the time to effective therapy and further improved antimicrobial use compared to ASP alone, even in a setting of low antimicrobial resistance rates.",Journal of clinical microbiology,2016,Shawn H MacVane; Frederick S Nolte,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacteremia', 'Blood Culture', 'Candidemia', 'Drug Utilization', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Non-Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",[],4
28350902,The Role of Stewardship in Addressing Antibacterial Resistance: Stewardship and Infection Control Committee of the Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group.,"Antibacterial resistance is increasing globally and has been recognized as a major public health threat. Antibacterial stewardship is the coordinated effort to improve the appropriate use of antibiotics with the aim to decrease selective pressure for multidrug-resistant organisms in order to preserve the utility of antibacterial agents. This article describes the activities of the Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group (ARLG) in the area of antibacterial stewardship. To date, the ARLG has focused intensely on development of rapid diagnostic tests, which (when coupled with educational and institutional initiatives) will enable the robust stewardship that is needed to address the current crisis of antibacterial resistance.

Accurate diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis is crucial to identify children who would benefit from antibiotic treatment. Rapid diagnosis has the potential to reduce antibiotic overuse. Current national guidelines differ in their recommendations for GAS testing. While rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) are widely used, their sensitivity is considered too low for stand-alone testing by several expert bodies. Newer molecular tests using nucleic acid amplification show higher accuracy and fast results, but their cost, complexity, and very high sensitivity may limit widespread adoption. This review provides up-to-date evidence regarding rapid diagnostic testing and antimicrobial stewardship in children with sore throat.

A process evaluation assessed determinants of practice and explored factors associated with antibiotic prescribing patterns. This work describes its findings on uptake and impacts of the complex intervention program and indicates potential implementation into routine care. In a nested mixed-methods approach, a three-wave study-specific survey for participating physicians and medical assistants assessed potential impacts and uptake of the complex intervention program. Stakeholders received a one-time online questionnaire to reflect on network-related aspects. Semi-structured, open-ended interviews, with a purposive sample of physicians, medical assistants and stakeholders, explored program component acceptance for daily practice and perceived sustainability of intervention component effects. Intervention components were perceived to be smoothly integrable into practice routines. The highest uptake was reported for educational components: feedback reports, background information, e-learning modules and disease-specific quality circles (QCs). Participation in PCNs was seen as the motivational factor for guideline-oriented patient care and adoption of new routines. Future approaches to fostering appropriate antibiotics use by targeting health literacy competencies and clinician's therapy decisions should combine evidence-based information sources, audit and feedback reports and QCs.","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,Regina Poss-Doering; Lukas Kühn; Martina Kamradt; Anna Stürmlinger; Katharina Glassen; Edith Andres; Petra Kaufmann-Kolle; Veit Wambach; Lutz Bader; Joachim Szecsenyi; Michel Wensing,[],"['appropriate antibiotics use', 'mixed-methods', 'primary care', 'quality improvement']",4

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of some selected carbapenemase genes among clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae recovered from patients attending a private tertiary hospital in Southwestern Nigeria. The study was conducted over two months (February-March 2024). A total of 50 clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae from different clinical specimens were obtained from the Medical Microbiology Department, Babcock University Teaching Hospital (BUTH). The clinical isolates were then characterized using standard microbiological procedures and were tested for susceptibility to meropenem and other classes of antibiotics according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) detection for OXA-48 and NDM-1 carbapenemase genes was performed on the 50 clinical isolates. PCR analysis showed that 9 (18%) clinical isolates were positive for the OXA-48 gene, 22 (44%) were positive for the NDM-1 gene, 4 (8%) possessed both the OXA-48 and NDM-1 genes, and 23 (46%) possessed neither the OXA-48 nor NDM-1 genes. Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing (AST) revealed that all the clinical isolates were resistant to meropenem. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the presence of OXA-48 and NDM-1 genes in clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae recovered from patients attending a private tertiary hospital in Southwestern Nigeria, highlighting the role of ESBL (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase) as a major resistance mechanism alongside other mechanisms. Population-based surveillance programs should be implemented to monitor the prevalence and epidemiology of Klebsiella pneumoniae infections at the community level, facilitating early detection of outbreaks and identification of emerging antimicrobial resistance patterns. CORE TIP: This study highlights the significant prevalence of NDM-1 and OXA-48 carbapenemase genes among Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates in a private tertiary hospital in Southwestern Nigeria, with 44% and 18% of isolates harboring these genes, respectively.

26734367,The use of an IV to PO clinical intervention form to improve antibiotic administration in a community based hospital.,"Antimicrobials are among the most commonly prescribed medications in acute care settings, with 50% of antimicrobial use deemed inappropriate. Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP) aim to optimize antibiotic use in order to improve patient clinical outcomes while minimizing unwanted effects of therapy including Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and the emergence of resistant organisms. Antimicrobial Stewardship involves a coordinated set of interventions that ensure patients who require antimicrobial therapy receive the most appropriate agent at the correct dose, by the correct route for the correct duration. This project focused on the appropriate conversion from intravenous (IV) to oral (PO) antibiotics. The purpose of the project was to determine whether antibiotic prescribing patterns improved following the implementation of an IV to PO conversion clinical intervention form. A collaborative approach was used by an interprofessional team to review medical records and design a clinical intervention form that adheres to evidence-based guidelines to promote appropriate conversion for patients on intravenous antibiotics. Education efforts were made to inform health system staff about the goal of the intervention and to gather feedback for the improvement of the clinical intervention form. A five-week pilot intervention period trial was carried out with a specific focus on the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics, specifically ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and levofloxacin. Data from the intervention phase, including overall antibiotic use, ratio of intravenous:oral antibiotic time and compliance with the clinical intervention form were assessed. The ratio of intravenous to oral fluoroquinolone use changed from 39.4% IV: 60.6% PO before the intervention, to 34.7% IV: 65.3% PO during the intervention, indicating an overall increase in the usage of oral fluoroquinolones during the intervention phase. In patients eligible to receive the clinical intervention form, physician compliance with the form was 50%. IV duration decreased by 42% in patients with physician compliance. Further refinement of this form and the process for implementation will further enhance the conversion of intravenous to oral therapy. Based on these findings and the lessons learned, this process will be considered for further refinements, spread, and sustainability.",BMJ quality improvement reports,2015,Cameron Thompson; Michelle Zahradnik; Allison Brown; Dimitra Gina Fleming; Madelyn Law,[],[],4

Study on the antibiotic use of specialized hospitals in China in 2011-2012.,"With dwindling number of new antibiotics and inappropriate use of antibiotics, the emergence and spread of antibiotics resistance occurs commonly in healthcare institutions worldwide. In China, antibiotics are commonly over prescribed and misused. This study is to assess the effect of the nationwide special campaign on antibiotic stewardship program (ASP) at specialized hospitals in China by investigating prescription information from 2011 to 2012. Data on the hospital consumption and prescription of systemic antibiotics were obtained from four specialized hospitals, including maternity, children's, stomatological and cancer hospitals. Systematic random sampling was used to select outpatient prescriptions and inpatient cases. A total of 105 specialized hospitals in 2011 and 121 specialized hospitals in 2012 were analysed. The defined daily doses (DDDs) per 100 inpatient days, the percentage of antibiotic use in outpatient prescriptions, and the percentage of antibiotic use in inpatient cases were used as measurements of antibiotic use. The overall antibiotic use density in the selected hospitals decreased between 2011 and 2012 from 39.37 to 26.54 DDD/100 inpatient days (P<0.001). The percentage of antibiotic use in outpatient prescriptions (range: 24.12%-18.71%, P=0.109) and inpatient cases (64.85%-60.10%, P=0.006) also decreased within the two years. Significant changes were observed among regions and different hospitals within the two years. And antibiotic consumption was correlated with the type and size of specialized hospital in 2012, but not with the regions. This analysis of antibiotic consumption of specialized hospitals allows relevant comparisons for benchmarking and shows that national ASP has improved antibiotic rational use in China.

34128462,Rapid diagnostic testing for antimicrobial stewardship: Utility in Asia Pacific.,"Rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) can provide prompt, accurate identification of infectious organisms and be a key component of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs. However, their use is less widespread in Asia Pacific than western countries. Cost can be prohibitive, particularly in less resource-replete settings. A selective approach is required, possibly focusing on the initiation of antimicrobials, for differentiating bacterial versus viral infections and identifying locally relevant tropical diseases. Across Asia Pacific, more data are needed on RDT use within AMS, focusing on the impact on antimicrobial usage, patient morbidity and mortality, and cost effectiveness. Moreover, in the absence of formal guidelines, regional consensus statements to guide clinical practice are warranted. These will provide a regionally relevant definition for RDT; greater consensus on its role in managing infections; advice on implementation and overcoming barriers; and guidance on optimizing human resource capacity. By addressing these issues, the outcomes of AMS programs should improve.",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,2021,Anucha Apisarnthanarak; Hong Bin Kim; Luke Moore; Yonghong Xiao; Sanjeev Singh; Yohei Doi; Andrea Lay-Hoon Kwa; Sasheela Sri La Sri Ponnampalavanar; Qing Cao; Shin-Woo Kim; Hyukmin Lee; Pitak Santanirand,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Asia', 'Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures', 'Humans']",[],4

Our objective was to assess antimicrobial use among suspected COVID-19 in-patients. From March to August 2020, we collected data from in-patients of 12 tertiary-level hospitals across Bangladesh. We identified suspected COVID-19 patients; collected information on antimicrobial received within 24 h before and on hospitalization; tested nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 using rRT-PCR. We used descriptive statistics and a regression model for data analysis. Among 1188 suspected COVID-19 patients, 69% were male, 40% had comorbidities, and 53% required oxygen. Antibiotics were used in 92% of patients, 47% within 24 h before, and 89% on admission. Patients also received antiviral (1%) and antiparasitic drugs (3%). Third-generation cephalosporin use was the highest (708; 60%), followed by macrolide (481; 40%), and the majority (853; 78%) who took antibiotics were SARS-CoV-2 negative. On admission, 77% mild and 94% moderately ill patients received antibiotics. Antibiotic use on admission was higher among severely ill patients (AOR = 11.7; 95% CI: 4.5-30.1) and those who received antibiotics within 24 h before hospital admission (AOR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.0-2.5). Antimicrobial use was highly prevalent among suspected COVID-19 in-patients in Bangladesh. Initiating treatment with third-generation cephalosporin among mild to moderately ill patients was common. Promoting antimicrobial stewardship with monitoring is essential to prevent blanket antibiotic use, thereby mitigating antimicrobial resistance.","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Syeda Mah-E-Muneer; Md Zakiul Hassan; Md Abdullah Al Jubayer Biswas; Fahmida Rahman; Zubair Akhtar; Pritimoy Das; Md Ariful Islam; Fahmida Chowdhury,[],"['Bangladesh', 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'antibiotic', 'antimicrobial use', 'suspected COVID-19']",4

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in adult women is usually treated with long-term, low-dose antibiotics and current national and international guidelines recommend this as the 'gold standard' preventative treatment. Although they are reasonably effective, long-term antibiotics can result in bacteria becoming resistant not only to the prescribed antibiotic but to other antimicrobial agents.

34635692,Impact of target site mutations and plasmid associated resistance genes acquisition on resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii to fluoroquinolones.,"Among bacterial species implicated in hospital-acquired infections are the emerging Pan-Drug Resistant (PDR) and Extensively Drug-Resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter (A.) baumannii strains as they are difficult to eradicate. From 1600 clinical specimens, only 100 A. baumannii isolates could be recovered. A high prevalence of ≥ 78% resistant isolates was recorded for the recovered isolates against a total of 19 tested antimicrobial agents. These isolates could be divided into 12 profiles according to the number of antimicrobial agents to which they were resistant. The isolates were assorted as XDR (68; 68%), Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR: 30; 30%), and PDR (2; 2%). Genotypically, the isolates showed three major clusters with similarities ranging from 10.5 to 97.8% as revealed by ERIC-PCR technique. As a resistance mechanism to fluoroquinolones (FQs), target site mutation analyses in gyrA and parC genes amplified from twelve selected A. baumannii isolates and subjected to sequencing showed 12 profiles. The selected isolates included two CIP-susceptible ones, these showed the wild-type profile of being have no mutations. For the ten selected CIP-resistant isolates, 9 of them (9/10; 90%) had 1 gyrA/1 parC mutations (Ser 81 → Leu mutation for gyrA gene and Ser 84 → Leu mutation for parC gene). The remaining CIP-resistant isolate (1/10; 10%) had 0 gyrA/1 parC mutation (Ser 84 → Leu mutation for parC gene). Detection of plasmid-associated resistance genes revealed that the 86 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates carry qnrA (66.27%; 57/86), qnrS (70.93%; 61/86), aac (6')-Ib-cr (52.32%; 45/86), oqxA (73.25%; 63/86) and oqxB (39.53%; 34/86), while qepA and qnrB were undetected in these isolates. Different isolates were selected from profiles 1, 2, and 3 and qnrS, acc(6,)-ib-cr, oqxA, and oqxB genes harbored by these isolates were amplified and sequenced. The BLAST results revealed that the oqxA and oqxB sequences were not identified previously in A. baumannii but they were identified in Klebsiella aerogenes strain NCTC9793 and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively. On the other hand, the sequence of qnrS, and acc(6,)-ib-cr showed homology to those of A. baumannii. MDR, XDR, and PDR A. baumannii isolates are becoming prevalent in certain hospitals. Chromosomal mutations in the sequences of GyrA and ParC encoding genes and acquisition of PAFQR encoding genes (up to five genes per isolate) are demonstrated to be resistance mechanisms exhibited by fluoroquinolones resistant A. baumannii isolates. It is advisable to monitor the antimicrobial resistance profiles of pathogens causing nosocomial infections and properly apply and update antibiotic stewardship in hospitals and outpatients to control infectious diseases and prevent development of the microbial resistance to antimicrobial agents.",Scientific reports,2021,Mostafa Ahmed Mohammed; Mohammed T A Salim; Bahaa E Anwer; Khaled M Aboshanab; Mohammad M Aboulwafa,"['Acinetobacter Infections', 'Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'DNA Gyrase', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Plasmids']",[],4

40775863,Use of the Learning Health System to Redesign and Implement a Clinical Decision Support System for Antimicrobial Stewardship.,"Antimicrobial resistance is a significant global health issue, and Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) services in hospitals are key to addressing this. Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) are vital tools that support AMS programs. Guidance MS, a CDSS developed in 2005, has been implemented in over 60 Australian hospitals, yielding positive outcomes such as reduced gram-negative resistance, decreased antimicrobial consumption, and improved prescribing practices. This CDSS was redesigned to continue to support national AMS accreditation standards and meet evolving needs in digital healthcare. The CDSS included features for formulary restriction, clinical decision support, post-prescription review, auditing, and interactive reports for feedback. This paper outlines how the Learning Health System (LHS) framework was applied to redesign, develop, implement and evaluate the updated CDSS. The LHS framework operates through iterative cycles of practice-to-data, data-to-knowledge, and knowledge-to-practice. A Learning Health Community was established, which provided input to guide system design. Key considerations for the new CDSS included a user-centred approach, interoperability with electronic medical records (EMR), and adherence to national regulatory standards for Software As a Medical Device. Following an Agile development process, the redesigned system underwent extensive testing and iterative improvements. The program was then implemented in a beta site, a large, tertiary hospital. Extensive User Acceptance Testing was conducted, with feedback and improvements incorporated into the first version release. The program was then implemented in a network of thirteen hospitals. Formal and anecdotal feedback from the project team and clinicians showed high satisfaction regarding usability, performance, clinician workflow improvement, content quality, and efficiency. The LHS framework enabled user feedback to drive rapid enhancements to the program, ensuring it met identified needs. The implementation projects provided valuable insights into workflows, enhancing project delivery and informing strategies for future application improvements and scalability. Future development will include establishing two-way integration with EMRs and mobile devices. A socio-technical evaluation will assess the program's perceived usability and usefulness, supporting continuous improvement as part of LHS methodology. A formal evaluation will assess clinical impact on hospital and patient outcomes, providing evidence to guide ongoing optimisation.The LHS is a useful framework for designing, developing, implementing and evaluating digital healthcare solutions for AMS, which continues to inform improvements, enabling provision of an effective, scalable and sustainable, digital solution.",Studies in health technology and informatics,2025,Ngan-Ha Truong; Zohal Rashidzada; Jenna Maleki; Pramode Varghese; Sri Elkins; Caroline Chen; Rod James; Karin Thursky,"['Decision Support Systems, Clinical', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Learning Health System', 'Australia', 'Humans', 'Electronic Health Records']","['Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Digital Health', 'Learning Health System']",4

Between November 2016, and June 2019 we studied 79 samples of cerebrospinal fluid from patients admitted to our emergency department with suspected diagnoses of meningitis or encephalitis. FilmArray ME panel was used routinely in addition to conventional laboratory methods for the identification of microorganisms in cerebrospinal fluid samples (CSF). A total of 46 (58%) patients had clinical and CSF results suggestive of meningitis or encephalitis, and 24 (30%) had a confirmed microbiological diagnosis. Patients' mean age was 41 years (range 2 months to 90 years) and 56% were male. Four patients had been partially treated with antibiotics. FilmArray ME identified 23 cases (1 fungal, 11 bacterial, and 11 viral). Gram staining showed microorganisms in 5 cases (1 fungal, 4 bacterial), and conventional microbiology cultures identified 8 cases (1 fungal and 7 bacterial). The time difference (95% confidence interval) between FilmArray ME and cerebrospinal fluid culture results was 3.2 days (95% CI 2.7-3.7; P < 0.001).

Computerised decision support systems may help practitioners to make evidence-based decisions when prescribing antibiotics. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the impact of computerized decision support systems on the volume of antibiotics used. Setting A very large 1200-bed teaching hospital in Birmingham, England. Main outcome measure The primary outcome measure was the defined daily doses/1000 occupied bed-days. Method A retrospective longitudinal study was conducted to examine the impact of computerised decision support systems on the volume of antibiotic use. The study compared two periods: one with computerised decision support systems, which lasted for 2 years versus one without which lasted for 2 years after the withdrawal of computerised decision support systems. Antibiotic use data from June 2012 to June 2016 were analysed (comprising 2 years with computerised decision support systems immediately followed by 2 years where computerised decision support systems had been withdrawn). Regression analysis was applied to assess the change in antibiotic consumption through the period of the study. Result From June 2012 to June 2016, total antibiotic usage increased by 13.1% from 1436 to 1625 defined daily doses/1000 bed-days: this trend of increased antibiotic prescribing was more pronounced following the withdrawal of structured prescribing (computerised decision support systems). There was a difference of means of - 110.14 defined daily doses/1000 bed days of the total usage of antibiotics in the period with and without structured prescribing, and this was statistically significant (p = 0.026). From June 2012 to June 2016, the dominant antibiotic class used was penicillins. The trends for the total consumption of all antibiotics demonstrated an increase of use for all antibiotic classes except for tetracyclines, quinolones, and anti-mycobacterial drugs, whereas aminoglycoside usage remained stable. Conclusion The implementation of computerised decision support systems appears to influence the use of antibiotics by reducing their consumption.

In this observational birth cohort study nested in a randomized controlled trial in Dhaka, Bangladesh, inpatient antimicrobial prescription data were extracted from serious adverse event forms completed for hospitalizations of infants (0-12 months of age). The primary outcome was the proportion of inpatient admissions where systemic antimicrobials were prescribed. Infant and hospitalization-related factors associated with antimicrobial prescriptions were determined. Among 1254 infants, there were 448 admissions to 32 facilities from 2014 to 2016. Antimicrobials were prescribed in 73% of admissions with a mean antimicrobial exposure rate of 0.25 antimicrobials per day of admission [95% confidence intervals (95% CIs): 0.24-0.27]. The most common antibiotics were aminoglycosides (29%), penicillins (26%) and third-generation cephalosporins (25%).

The first survey aimed to assess those characteristics of Spanish PICUs that could influence antimicrobial prescribing or antimicrobial stewardship. The second survey targeted Spanish PICU physicians and pursued to assess their attitudes and perceptions regarding antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial use. Information about 29/39 contacted PICUs was obtained. A total of 114/206 (55.3%) paediatric intensivists responded. PICUs were heterogeneous regarding years since foundation, number of beds, type of patients admitted and staffing. Only 11 (37.9%) PICUs had available e-prescribing systems.

The degree of error in the recommendations regarding the in vitro activity of the isolated strains was 5.9% and remained stable during the study period. Antibiotic families correctly prescribed according to the guidelines were third-generation cephalosporins (54.9%), carbapenems (16.8%) and combinations of penicillins and beta-lactamase inhibitors (16.4%). Of the 8009 E. coli strains, 19.0% were extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producers, 36.8% were resistant to quinolones and 0.5% were resistant to carbapenems. The broad implementation of an antimicrobial stewardship program with quality indicators of antibiotic use improved compliance to local guidelines in the empiric treatment of urinary tract E. coli bacteraemia. The degree of error in local guidelines was low but higher in more complex hospitals and in healthcare-associated infections.

38952583,A Comprehensive Review of Innovative Paradigms in Microbial Detection and Antimicrobial Resistance: Beyond Traditional Cultural Methods.,"Microbial detection and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance are critical components of public health efforts to combat infectious diseases and preserve the efficacy of antimicrobial agents. While foundational in microbial identification, traditional cultural methods are often laborious, time-consuming, and limited in their ability to detect AMR markers. In response to these challenges, innovative paradigms have emerged, leveraging advances in molecular biology, genomics, proteomics, nanotechnology, and bioinformatics. This comprehensive review provides an overview of innovative approaches beyond traditional cultural methods for microbial detection and AMR surveillance. Molecular-based techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) offer enhanced sensitivity and specificity, enabling the rapid identification of microbial pathogens and AMR determinants. Mass spectrometry-based methods provide rapid and accurate detection of microbial biomarkers, including matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) and biosensor technologies. Nanotechnology approaches, such as nanoparticle-based assays and nanopore sequencing, offer novel platforms for sensitive and label-free detection of pathogens and AMR markers. Embracing these innovative paradigms holds immense promise for improving disease diagnosis, antibiotic stewardship, and AMR containment efforts. However, challenges such as cost, standardization, and integration with existing healthcare systems must be addressed to realize the full potential of these technologies. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation, we can strengthen our ability to detect, monitor, and combat AMR, safeguarding public health for generations.",Cureus,2024,Shahzad Ahmad; Sham Lohiya; Amar Taksande; Revat J Meshram; Ashish Varma; Keta Vagha,[],"['antimicrobial resistance (amr)', 'innovative paradigms', 'mass spectrometry', 'microbial detection', 'molecular-based techniques', 'nanotechnology']",4
38963103,Diagnostic Stewardship in Clinical Microbiology: An Indispensable Component of Patient Care.,"Emerging infectious diseases and increasing resistance to available antimicrobials are mapping the evolution of clinical microbiology and escalating the nature of undertakings required. Rapid diagnosis has become the need of the hour, which can affect diagnostic algorithms and therapeutic decisions simultaneously. Subsequently, the concept of 'diagnostic stewardship' was introduced into clinical practice for coherent implementation of available diagnostic modalities to ensure that these new rapid diagnostic technologies are conserved, rather than consumed as part of health care resources, with a view to improve the patient care and reduce Turnaround Time (TAT) and treatment expense. The present study highlights the requisite of diagnostic stewardship and outlines the infectious disease diagnostic modalities that can assist in its successful implementation. Diagnostic stewardship promotes precise, timely diagnostics, from the initial specimen collection and identification to reporting with appropriate TAT, so as to enable timely management of the patient. The main aim of diagnostic stewardship is to optimize the right choice of diagnostic test for the right patient to attain clinically significant reports with the least possible TAT for timely management and the least expected adverse effects for the patient, community, and the healthcare system. This underlines the requisite of a multifaceted approach to make technological advancements effective and successful for implementation as a part of diagnostic stewardship for the best patient care.",Infectious disorders drug targets,2025,Lipika Singhal; Parakriti Gupta; Varsha Gupta,"['Humans', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Diagnostic Tests, Routine', 'Microbiological Techniques', 'Patient Care']","['Diagnostic stewardship', 'antimicrobial stewardship', 'clinical microbiology', 'patient care.', 'rapid tests', 'turnaround time']",4

Aztreonam, a relatively high-cost antipseudomonal antibiotic, is an appropriate target for stewardship initiatives based on propensity for overuse in penicillin allergy, an activity profile often warranting additional empiric gram-negative and gram-positive coverage, and a unique durability to Ambler class B metallo-beta-lactamases. Objective Analyze the immediate and long-term impact on aztreonam prescribing of combining restrictive and enabling interventions. Setting Single 233-bed community hospital with 45 adult intensive care unit beds in Nashville, Tennessee. Method Retrospective, interrupted time series analysis comparing all patients receiving aztreonam prior to intervention between January 1, 2010 and September 30, 2011 and following intervention between October 1, 2011 and September 30, 2019. Quarterly defined daily doses/1000 adjusted patient days and microbiology laboratory annual surveillance data were utilized for analysis. Main outcome measure Post-intervention change in trend of aztreonam consumption. Results Following intervention, a significant decline in aztreonam consumption was observed (- 1.97 defined daily doses/1000 adjusted patient days; p = 0.003) resulting in a sustained decrease in aztreonam consumption from 2011 (3rd quarter) to 2019 (3rd quarter) from 15.2 to 0.26 defined daily doses/1000 adjusted patient days. Short-term group 2 carbapenem consumption increased (p = 0.044). Pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptibility to aztreonam improved from 2011 to 2018 (72% vs. 84%; p = 0.0004) without deleterious effects to alternative antipseudomonal beta-lactams.

31585473,Biomarkers of Infection: Are They Useful in the ICU?,"Biomarkers are increasingly used in patients with serious infections in the critical care setting to complement clinical judgment and interpretation of other diagnostic and prognostic tests. The main purposes of such blood markers are (1) to improve infection diagnosis (i.e., differentiation between bacterial vs. viral vs. fungal vs. noninfectious), (2) to help in the early risk stratification and thus provide prognostic information regarding the risk for mortality and other adverse outcomes, and (3) to optimize antibiotic tailoring to individual needs of patients (""antibiotic stewardship"").Especially in critically ill patients, in whom sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, rapid diagnosis is desirable to start timely and specific treatment.Besides some biomarkers, such as procalcitonin, which is well established and has shown positive effects in regard to utilization of antimicrobials and clinical outcomes, there is a growing number of novel markers from different pathophysiological pathways, where the final proof of an added value to clinical judgment and ultimately clinical benefit to patients is still lacking.Without a doubt, the addition of blood biomarkers to clinical medicine has had a strong impact on the way we care for patients today. Recent trials show that as an adjunct to other clinical and laboratory parameters these markers provide important information about risks for bacterial infection and resolution of infection. Moreover, biomarkers can help to optimize management of patients with serious illness in the intensive care unit, thereby offering more individualized treatment courses with overall improvements in clinical outcomes.",Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,2019,Eva Heilmann; Claudia Gregoriano; Philipp Schuetz,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Biomarkers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Sepsis']",[],4
25102101,Is there a role for antimicrobial stewardship in cystic fibrosis?,"There is currently considerable interest in developing antimicrobial stewardship programs in pediatric and adult acute and chronic care hospitals as a method of preserving the activity of existing antimicrobial agents against an increasing number of multidrug-resistant organisms. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is recognized as one of the conditions associated with the highest use of antimicrobials in pediatrics and has thus been identified as a potential target of antimicrobial stewardship programs. The benefits of aggressive antibiotic use to treat pulmonary infections in individuals with CF are well defined and it is not always possible to follow the stewardship principle of narrowing antimicrobial spectrum based on susceptibility testing and treating with short antibiotic courses. However, antimicrobial stewardship still has a role to play in CF. There are practical solutions that can be currently applied. For chronic suppressive antimicrobial therapy, aerosolization is the most effective route, achieving high intrapulmonary concentrations with few systemic toxicities. Given the absence of evidence demonstrating benefit, prolonged intravenous and oral antibiotic courses should generally be avoided. Increasing the number of antibiotics does not necessarily confer a clinical advantage; trials of cycling different antibiotics should be studied as it may have potential benefits both regarding efficacy and development of resistance. Further research is clearly needed in this area to optimize the antibiotic management of this population.",Annals of the American Thoracic Society,2014,Valerie J Waters; Felix A Ratjen,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pseudomonas Infections', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Treatment Outcome']","['Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'antibiotics', 'cystic fibrosis']",4
27873682,Optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy in ventilator-associated pneumonia: What is the role for procalcitonin?,"Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is the major cause of hospital-acquired infections in critically ill patients. Up to 90% of intensive care unit episodes of HAP occur in mechanically ventilated patients, who may develop what is termed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). An appropriate duration of antimicrobial therapy is crucial in the management of HAP: on the one hand, delay in administration of proper therapy has been associated with an increased risk of treatment failure and mortality; on the other hand, unnecessary prolongation of antimicrobial treatment may favour the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria and increase healthcare costs. In this review, we discuss the evidence and recommendations from international guidelines for the management of VAP and focus on randomised controlled trials comparing the clinical efficacy of a short-course vs. an extended-course antimicrobial regimen for the treatment of VAP in adults. In these trials, short-course regimens were as effective and safe as long-course regimens for the treatment of VAP, provided that infection was not due to difficult-to-treat micro-organisms such as non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli. In addition, strategies incorporating individualised stop-points for antibiotics, i.e. clinical features or biomarkers such as procalcitonin, were shown to reduce antibiotic exposure, healthcare costs and the risk of developing antimicrobial resistance, without negatively affecting other outcomes.",Journal of global antimicrobial resistance,2014,Marilia Rita Pinzone; Bruno Cacopardo; Lilian Abbo; Giuseppe Nunnari,[],"['Antimicrobial stewardship', 'Duration of antimicrobial therapy', 'Guidelines', 'VAP', 'Ventilator-associated pneumonia']",4
39417838,Management of neonates at risk of early onset sepsis: a probability-based approach and recent literature appraisal : Update of the Swiss national guideline of the Swiss Society of Neonatology and the Pediatric Infectious Disease Group Switzerland.,"In Switzerland and other high-income countries, one out of 3000 to 5000 term and late preterm neonates develops early onset sepsis (EOS) associated with a mortality of around 3%, while incidence and mortality of EOS in very preterm infants are substantially higher. Exposure to antibiotics for suspected EOS is disproportionally high compared to the incidence of EOS with consequences for future health and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). A safe reduction of unnecessary antibiotic treatment has to be a major goal of new management strategies and guidelines. Antibiotics should be administered immediately in situations with clinical signs of septic shock. Group B streptococcus (GBS) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) are the leading pathogens of EOS. Amoxicillin combined with an aminoglycoside remains the first choice for empirical treatment. Serial physical examinations are recommended for all neonates with risk factors for EOS. Neonates without any clinical signs suggestive of EOS should not be treated with antibiotics. In Switzerland, we do not recommend the use of the EOS calculator, a risk stratification tool, due to its unclear impact in a population with an observed antibiotic exposure below 3%. Not all neonates with respiratory distress should be empirically treated with antibiotics. Isolated tachypnea or respiratory distress starting immediately after delivery by elective caesarean section or a clearly assessed alternative explanation than EOS for clinical signs may point towards a low probability of sepsis. On the other hand, unexplained prematurity with risk factors has an inherent higher risk of EOS. Before the start of antibiotic therapy, blood cultures should be drawn with a minimum volume of 1 ml in a single aerobic blood culture bottle. This standard procedure allows antibiotics to be stopped after 24 to 36 h if no pathogen is detected in blood cultures. Current data do not support the use of PCR-based pathogen detection in blood as a standard method. Lumbar puncture is recommended in blood culture-proven EOS, critical illness, or in the presence of neurological symptoms such as seizures or altered consciousness. The accuracy of a single biomarker measurement to distinguish inflammation from infection is low in neonates. Therefore, biomarker guidance is not a standard part of decision-making regarding the start or stop of antibiotic therapy but may be used as part of an algorithm and after appropriate education of health care teams. Every newborn started on antibiotics should be assessed for organ dysfunction with prompt initiation of respiratory and hemodynamic support if needed. An elevated lactate may be a sign of poor perfusion and requires a comprehensive assessment of the clinical condition. Interventions to restore perfusion include fluid boli with crystalloids and catecholamines. Neonates in critical condition should be cared for in a specialized unit. In situations with a low probability of EOS, antibiotics should be stopped as early as possible within the first 24 h after the start of therapy. In cases with microbiologically proven EOS, reassessment and streamlining of antibiotic therapy in neonates is an important step to minimize AMR.",European journal of pediatrics,2024,Martin Stocker; Flavia Rosa-Mangeret; Philipp K A Agyeman; Jane McDougall; Christoph Berger; Eric Giannoni,"['Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Infant, Premature', 'Neonatal Sepsis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Switzerland']","['Antibiotic therapy', 'Antimicrobial stewardship', 'Early onset sepsis', 'Guideline', 'Neonatal sepsis']",4

Its increasing detection in hospital settings, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs), raises concerns regarding nosocomial transmission and antibiotic resistance. A total of 187 K. pneumoniae isolates from patients at the Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, were screened phenotypically and genotypically. The hypermucoviscous phenotype was assessed using the string test and PCR was used to detect virulence genes (rmpA, rmpA2, and iucA). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) detection were conducted, and statistical analyses were performed to compare the hvKp and cKp isolates. hvKp accounted for 9.63% of all isolates. These strains were significantly associated with the presence of rmpA, rmpA2, and iucA genes. Although no statistically significant differences in antimicrobial resistance were observed between hvKp and cKp, the hvKp strains exhibited relatively lower resistance rates. A slightly higher but non-significant ESBL production rate was noted among the hvKp isolates. Diabetes and renal failure emerged as significant risk factors for hvKp infection, whereas age showed no such association. The detection of hvKp in ICU settings, coupled with its virulence potential and relative antibiotic susceptibility, underscores the urgent need for enhanced surveillance, infection control, and targeted antimicrobial stewardship. Future research should focus on the genomic evolution of hvKp and its interplay with host factors to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.",Scientific reports,2025,Hamideh Najafian; Omid Pouresmaeil; Zahra Meshkat; Ehsan Aryan; Jamal Falahi; Leyla Najafian; Hadi Farsiani,"['Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'Iran', 'Klebsiella Infections', 'Humans', 'Prevalence', 'Male', 'Virulence', 'Female', 'Virulence Factors', 'Middle Aged', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Adult', 'beta-Lactamases', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Cross Infection']","['Aerobactin', 'Antimicrobial resistance', 'Hypermucoviscous phenotype', 'Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP)', 'Nosocomial infections']",4

As the data for utility of PCT to discontinue antibiotics in an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) are lacking, we aim to describe the outcomes of patients in whom PCT was used to discontinue antibiotics under our ASP. An antimicrobial stewardship (AS) team intervened to discontinue antibiotics in patients with persistent fever or leucocytosis, source of sepsis unknown or negative bacteriological cultures, who had completed an adequate course of antibiotic therapy and had a PCT of <0.5 μg/L. Main outcomes evaluated were 14-day re-infection, 30-day mortality and readmission. Antibiotic therapy was discontinued in 42 patients in 1 year. Unknown source of sepsis was found in 38% of the patients (including possible malignant fever) and culture-negative pneumonia was found in 21%. Two patients died of advanced cancer. One patient decided for comfort care and died one week later. One patient died due to a second episode of pneumonia 37 days after first PCT test.

This trial aimed to evaluate the impact of a systematic postprescription review performed by antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) infectious disease physicians (IDP) on the quality of in-hospital antibiotic use. A multicenter, prospective, randomized, parallel-group trial using the PROBE (Prospective Randomized Open-label Blinded Endpoint) methodology was conducted in eight surgical or medical wards of four hospitals. Two hundred forty-six patients receiving antibiotic therapy prescribed by ward physicians for less than 24 hours were randomized to receive either a systematic review by the ASP IDP at day 1 and days 3 to 4 (intervention group, n = 123) or no systematic review (usual care, n = 123). The primary outcome measure was appropriateness of antimicrobial therapy, a composite score of appropriateness of antibiotic use at days 3 to 4 and appropriate treatment duration, adjudicated by a blinded committee. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. In the intervention group, appropriateness of antimicrobial therapy was more frequent (55/123, 44.7% vs. 35/123, 28.5%; odds ratio 2.03, 95% confidence interval 1.20-3.45). Antibiotic treatment duration was lower in the intervention group (median (interquartile range) 7 (3-9) days vs. 10 (7-12) days; p 0.003). ASP IDP counseling to change therapy was more frequent at days 3 to 4 than at day 1 (114/123; 92.7% vs. 24/123; 19.5%, p <0.001). Clinical outcome was similar between groups. This study suggests that a systematic postprescription antibiotic review performed at days 1 and 3 to 4 results in higher quality of antibiotic use and lower antibiotic duration.

39964472,"Molecular characterization of metallo-beta-lactamase producers among carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa from clinical samples in a tertiary care hospital, Lucknow, India.","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a significant opportunistic pathogen in healthcare-associated infections. Its intrinsic resistance and ability to acquire resistance genes pose therapeutic challenges, particularly with the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR), and pan-drug-resistant (PDR) strains. This study aimed to assess the prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility, and metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) resistance genes (blaNDM, blaOXA48) in P. aeruginosa isolates from clinical samples over 14 months. A total of 4410 clinical samples were processed, yielding 241 non-duplicate P. aeruginosa isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) identified MDR, XDR, and PDR isolates. Carbapenemase production was detected using the eCIM test, and blaNDM and blaOXA48 genes were identified via PCR. Among the 241 isolates, 128 (53.1%) were from female patients and 113 (46.9%) from males. The most common sample sources were pus 111 (46.1%), sputum 36 (14.9%), and urine 35 (14.5%). The highest prevalence was observed in the Medicine department (45, 18.7%) and TB & Chest (42, 17.4%). Inpatients contributed 126 (52.3%) isolates, while 115 (47.7%) were from outpatients. AST showed the highest sensitivity to piperacillin/tazobactam (70.2%), piperacillin (67.2%), and tobramycin (67.6%), while imipenem (47.7%) and ceftazidime (33.6%) exhibited the lowest sensitivity. MDR was identified in 88 (36.5%) isolates, XDR in 29 (12.0%), and PDR in 9 (3.7%). MDR isolates were most common in pus (33, 13.6%), while XDR and PDR were frequently found in bronchoalveolar lavage (6, 2.4%) and urine (3, 1.2%), respectively. Among 20 eCIM-positive isolates, all carried the blaNDM gene, and 17 (85.0%) harbored blaOXA48. Males accounted for 70.0% of blaNDM and 70.6% of blaOXA48 cases. The highest prevalence of blaNDM (35.0%) was in the 41-60 age group, while blaOXA48 was equally distributed between the 20-40 and 41-60 age groups (35.3% each). Sputum (25.0% blaNDM, 23.5% blaOXA48) and urine (20.0% each) were the most common specimen sources. This study demonstrates the presence of antimicrobial resistance in P. aeruginosa isolates, including MDR, XDR, and PDR strains.

These bacteria are increasingly becoming resistant to the most commonly available treatment options. As a choice, the macrolide lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) is used, with clindamycin being the preferred drug. However, an alarming number of staphylococcal strains are developing resistance to MLSB. The resistance exhibits several phenotypes, including inducible MLSB (iMLSB), constitutive MLSB (cMLSB), and macrolide streptogramin B (MSB). One of the biggest challenges is the accurate detection of iMLSB in routine laboratory tests, as they appear erythromycin-resistant and clindamycin-sensitive unless the two antibiotics are placed adjacent to each other, which leads to clinical therapeutic failure.",PloS one,2025,Mariyam Khursheed; Maryam Sulaiman; Abdulrahman M Alhassan; Tameem H Al Awad; Ahmed E Ibrahim; Godwin Wilson; Hana A Abdelrahaman; Nahla O Eltai,"['Clindamycin', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Humans', 'Phenotype', 'Genotype', 'Staphylococcal Infections', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Bacterial Proteins']",[],3

30623110,Electronic prescribing: introducing a stat optional dose to improve time to antibiotic on the acute medical unit.,"Darlington Memorial Hospital is a district general hospital in the North East of England. The acute medical unit (AMU) takes referrals from the emergency department and also direct from general practitioners (GPs) in the region. Research shows that early recognition and management of sepsis is key to improving outcomes and significantly decreases mortality. Having observed several cases of delayed sepsis management in patients referred from their GP, we aimed to improve time to antibiotic therapy in patients identified as having sepsis as per the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2016 NG51 sepsis guidelines. We analysed the time from admission to antibiotic administrations for patients referred to AMU via their GP with suspected sepsis. We found there was a significant delay between antibiotic prescribing and administration. Baseline data showed that only 36% of patients received a stat dose of antibiotic on admission. Results showed that those patients with a stat dose prescribed had a median time of 36 min from prescription to antibiotic compared with 98 min for those without. We introduced a stat antibiotic option with all antibiotic prescriptions on the electronic prescribing system, encouraging prescribers to administer a stat dose. Through focusing on antibiotic prescribing systems and practices over two PDSA cycles, we were able to improve the time from prescription to administration of antibiotics for patients with sepsis. We reduced the delay in antibiotic administration in patients with sepsis from 49 to 34 min, an improvement of 31% (15/49). The percentage of patients receiving a stat dose of antibiotics increased from 36% to 63%. While we acknowledge that there remains room for improvement with regards to antibiotic prescribing and sepsis management, we have made sustainable interventions with important improvements. E-prescribing systems must be evaluated and modified accordingly on a regular basis to ensure that they positively contribute to quality patient care and clinical practice.",BMJ open quality,2018,Thomas Robert Edward Jones; Kim Nurse,[],"['antibiotic management', 'continuous quality improvement', 'information technology', 'pdsa']",3
30365516,Phenotypic characterization and whole genome analysis of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria isolated from dogs in Germany.,"Asymptomatic colonization with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae has been described for humans, various mammal species, and birds. Here, antimicrobial resistant bacteria were recovered from dog feces originating in Germany, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Croatia, and Ukraine, with a subset of mostly E. coli isolates obtained from a longitudinal collection over twelve months. In vitro antimicrobial resistance testing revealed various patterns of resistance against single or all investigated beta-lactam antibiotics, with none of the 101 isolates resistant against two tested carbapenem antibiotics. Whole genome sequence analysis revealed bacteria species-specific patterns for 23 antimicrobial resistance coding DNA sequences (CDS) that were unapparent from the in vitro analysis alone. Phylogenetic analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) revealed clonal bacterial isolates originating from different dogs, suggesting transmission between dogs in the same community. However, individual resistant E. coli clones were not detected over a period longer than seven days. Multi locus sequence typing (MLST) of 85 E. coli isolates revealed 31 different sequence types (ST) with an accumulation of ST744 (n = 9), ST10 (n = 8), and ST648 (n = 6), although the world-wide hospital-associated CTX-M beta-lactamase producing ST131 was not detected. Neither the antimicrobial resistance CDSs patterns nor the phylogenetic analysis revealed an epidemiological correlation among the longitudinal isolates collected from a period longer than seven days. No genetic linkage could be associated with the geographic origin of isolates. In conclusion, healthy dogs frequently carry ESBL-producing bacteria, independent to prior treatment, which may be transmitted between individual dogs of the same community. Otherwise, these antimicrobial resistant bacteria share few commonalities, making their presence eerily unpredictable.",PloS one,2018,Tim Boehmer; Amy J Vogler; Astrid Thomas; Sabine Sauer; Markus Hergenroether; Reinhard K Straubinger; Dawn Birdsell; Paul Keim; Jason W Sahl; Charles H D Williamson; Julia M Riehm,"['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacteria', 'Dogs', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Genomics', 'Germany', 'Multilocus Sequence Typing', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'beta-Lactamases']",[],3

27683211,Characterization and genome sequencing of a Citrobacter freundii phage CfP1 harboring a lysin active against multidrug-resistant isolates.,"Citrobacter spp., although frequently ignored, is emerging as an important nosocomial bacterium able to cause various superficial and systemic life-threatening infections. Considered to be hard-to-treat bacterium due to its pattern of high antibiotic resistance, it is important to develop effective measures for early and efficient therapy. In this study, the first myovirus (vB_CfrM_CfP1) lytic for Citrobacter freundii was microbiologically and genomically characterized. Its morphology, activity spectrum, burst size, and biophysical stability spectrum were determined. CfP1 specifically infects C. freundii, has broad host range (>85 %; 21 strains tested), a burst size of 45 PFU/cell, and is very stable under different temperatures (-20 to 50 °C) and pH (3 to 11) values. CfP1 demonstrated to be highly virulent against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates up to 12 antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and fluroquinoles. Genomically, CfP1 has a dsDNA molecule with 180,219 bp with average GC content of 43.1 % and codes for 273 CDSs. The genome architecture is organized into function-specific gene clusters typical for tailed phages, sharing 46 to 94 % nucleotide identity to other Citrobacter phages. The lysin gene encoding a predicted D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase was also cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and its activity evaluated in terms of pH, ionic strength, and temperature. The lysine optimum activity was reached at 20 mM HEPES, pH 7 at 37 °C, and was able to significantly reduce all C. freundii (>2 logs) as well as Citrobacter koseri (>4 logs) strains tested. Interestingly, the antimicrobial activity of this enzyme was performed without the need of pretreatment with outer membrane-destabilizing agents. These results indicate that CfP1 lysin is a good candidate to control problematic Citrobacter infections, for which current antibiotics are no longer effective.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2016,Hugo Oliveira; Graça Pinto; Ana Oliveira; Carla Oliveira; Maria Alberta Faustino; Yves Briers; Lucília Domingues; Joana Azeredo,"['Bacteriolysis', 'Bacteriophages', 'Base Composition', 'Biophysical Phenomena', 'Citrobacter freundii', 'DNA', 'DNA, Viral', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Endopeptidases', 'Gene Order', 'Genome, Viral', 'Host Specificity', 'Myoviridae', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Temperature', 'Virulence']","['Antibiotic resistances', 'Bacteriophages', 'Gram-negative bacteria', 'Phage lysins', 'Therapy']",3
37508278,Effect of an E-Prescription Intervention on the Adherence to Surgical Chemoprophylaxis Duration in Cardiac Surgery: A Single Centre Experience.,"In our hospital, adherence to the guidelines for peri-operative antimicrobial prophylaxis (PAP) is suboptimal, with overly long courses being common. This practice does not offer any incremental benefit, and it only adds to the burden of antimicrobial consumption, promotes the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, and it is associated with adverse events. Our objective was to study the effect of an electronic reminder on the adherence to each element of PAP after cardiac surgery. We conducted a single center, before and after intervention, prospective cohort study from 1 June 2014 to 30 September 2017. The intervention consisted of a reminder of the hospital guidelines when ordering PAP through the hospital information system. The primary outcome was adherence to the suggested duration of PAP, while secondary outcomes included adherence to the other elements of PAP and incidence of surgical site infections (SSI). We have studied 1080 operations (400 pre-intervention and 680 post-intervention).

Urinalysis and urine culture are the main tools used for diagnosis. Whereas urinalysis is sufficiently sensitive for detecting UTI, it has a relatively low specificity, leading to unnecessary treatment with antibiotics and the risk of increasing antibiotic resistance. We performed an evaluation of the current diagnostic process with an expert-based label for UTI as outcome, retrospectively established using data from the Electronic Health Records. We found that the combination of urinalysis results with the Gram stain and other readily available parameters can be used effectively for predicting UTI. Based on the obtained information, we engineered a clinical decision support system (CDSS) using the reliable semi-supervised ensemble learning (RESSEL) method, and found it to be more accurate than urinalysis or the urine culture for prediction of UTI. The CDSS provides clinicians with this prediction within hours of ordering a culture and thereby enables them to hold off on prematurely prescribing antibiotics for UTI while awaiting the culture results.",Computers in biology and medicine,2022,Sjoerd de Vries; Thijs Ten Doesschate; Joan E E Totté; Judith W Heutz; Yvette G T Loeffen; Jan Jelrik Oosterheert; Dirk Thierens; Edwin Boel,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Humans', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Urinalysis', 'Urinary Tract Infections']","['Antibiotic stewardship', 'Clinical decision support', 'Ensemble learning', 'RESSEL', 'Semi-supervised learning', 'Urinary tract infection']",3

However, open-label trial designs, inconsistent algorithm adherence, and unclear stewardship practices have limited confidence in procalcitonin's benefit. The ADAPT-Sepsis trial addressed several of these gaps through a concealed intervention, robust stewardship, and head-to-head comparison with CRP. Procalcitonin-guided care reduced antibiotic use without significantly impacting mortality, while CRP-guided care showed no benefit. However, algorithm adherence was suboptimal and the absolute reduction in antibiotic duration with procalcitonin was only one day. As shorter fixed-duration therapy becomes standard, procalcitonin's utility in the ICU may decline. Embedding procalcitonin and other biomarkers into multifaceted stewardship strategies, and addressing barriers to clinician trust and implementation, is essential. Future research should also evaluate whether biomarker use earlier in the sepsis care pathway, particularly in Emergency Departments, can improve early diagnostic accuracy and enhance patient outcomes.",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,2025,Simran Gupta; Michael Klompas; Chanu Rhee,[],"['Antibiotic Stewardship', 'Biomarkers', 'Procalcitonin', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock']",3

Although COVID-19 is a viral illness, many patients admitted to hospital are prescribed antibiotics, based on concerns that COVID-19 patients may experience secondary bacterial infections, and the assumption that they may respond well to antibiotic therapy. This has led to an increase in antibiotic use for some hospitalised patients at a time when accumulating antibiotic resistance is a major global threat to health. Procalcitonin (PCT) is an inflammatory marker measured in blood samples and widely recommended to help diagnose bacterial infections and guide antibiotic treatment. The PEACH study will compare patient outcomes from English and Welsh hospitals that used PCT testing during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic with those from hospitals not using PCT. It will help to determine whether, and how, PCT testing should be used in the NHS in future waves of COVID-19 to protect patients from antibiotic overuse. PEACH is a retrospective observational cohort study using patient-level clinical data from acute hospital Trusts and Health Boards in England and Wales.

34238976,Impact of antifungal stewardship interventions on the susceptibility of colonized Candida species in pediatric patients with malignancy.,"There is a worldwide concern regarding the antimicrobial resistance and the inappropriate use of antifungal agents, which had led to an ever-increasing antifungal resistance. This study aimed to identify the antifungal susceptibility of colonized Candida species isolated from pediatric patients with cancer and evaluate the clinical impact of antifungal stewardship (AFS) interventions on the antifungal susceptibility of colonized Candida species. Candida species colonization was evaluated among hospitalized children with cancer in a tertiary teaching hospital, Shiraz 2017-2018. Samples were collected from the mouth, nose, urine, and stool of the patients admitted to our center and cultured on sabouraud dextrose agar. The isolated yeasts identified by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP). DNA Extracted and PCR amplification was performed using the ITS1 and ITS4 primer pairs and Msp I enzyme. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for amphotericin B, caspofungin, and azoles. The prevalence of Candida albicans in the present study was significantly higher than other Candida species. Candida albicans species were completely susceptible to the azoles. The susceptibility rate of C. albicans to amphotericin B and caspofungin was 93.1% and 97.1%, respectively. The fluconazole MIC values of Candida albicans decreased significantly during the post-AFS period (P < 0.001; mean difference: 72.3; 95% CI of the difference: 47.36-98.62). We found that ‏52.5% (53/117) of the isolated C. albicans were azole-resistant before AFS implementation, while only 1.5% (2/102) of the isolates were resistant after implementation of the AFS program (P < 0.001). C. albicans fluconazole and caspofungin resistant rate also decreased significantly (P < 0.001) after implementation of the AFS program [26 (32.9%) versus 0 (0.0%) and 11 (10.9%) versus 1 (0.9%), respectively]. Besides, fluconazole use (p < 0.05) and fluconazole expenditure reduced significantly (about one thousand US$ per year) after the AFS program. Our results confirm the positive effect of optimized antifungal usage and bedside intervention on the susceptibility of Candida species after the implementation of the AFS program. C. albicans and C. glabrata exhibited a significant increase in susceptibility after the execution of the AFS program.",Scientific reports,2021,Ali Amanati; Parisa Badiee; Hadis Jafarian; Fatemeh Ghasemi; Samane Nematolahi; Sezaneh Haghpanah; Seyedeh Sedigheh Hamzavi,"['Adolescent', 'Amphotericin B', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Candida', 'Caspofungin', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Drug Resistance, Fungal', 'Female', 'Fluconazole', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Neoplasms', 'Triazoles']",[],3

Colonization by MRSA increases the risk of infection and transmission, underscoring the importance of decolonization efforts. However, success of these decolonization protocols varies, raising the possibility that some MRSA strains may be more persistent than others. Here, we studied how the persistence of MRSA colonization correlates with genomic presence of antibiotic resistance genes. Our analysis using a Bayesian mixed effects survival model found that genetic determinants of high-level resistance to mupirocin was strongly associated with failure of the decolonization protocol. However, we did not see a similar effect with genetic resistance to chlorhexidine or other antibiotics. Including strain-specific random effects improved the predictive performance, indicating that some strain characteristics other than resistance also contributed to persistence. Study subject-specific random effects did not improve the model. Our results highlight the need to consider the properties of the colonizing MRSA strain when deciding which treatments to include in the decolonization protocol.",PLoS computational biology,2023,Fanni Ojala; Mohamad R Abdul Sater; Loren G Miller; James A McKinnell; Mary K Hayden; Susan S Huang; Yonatan H Grad; Pekka Marttinen,"['Humans', 'Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'Anti-Infective Agents, Local', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Staphylococcal Infections', 'Carrier State', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial']",[],3
37846280,Tailored Approach to Evaluation and Management of Early Onset Neonatal Sepsis in a Safety-Net Teaching Hospital in Northeast Florida.,"Objective Early onset neonatal sepsis (EONS) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in newborns in the immediate postnatal period. High empiric antibiotic use in well-appearing infants with known risk factors for sepsis led the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) to revise its 2010 guidelines for the evaluation and management of EONS to avoid overuse of antibiotics. In this recent clinical report, the AAP provided a framework that outlined several evidence-based approaches for sepsis risk assessment in newborns that can be adopted by institutions based on local resources and structure. One of these approaches, the sepsis risk calculator (SRC) developed by Kaiser Permanente, has been widely validated for reducing unnecessary antibiotic exposure and blood work in infants suspected of having EONS. In order to determine the utility and safety of modifying our institution's protocol to the SRC, we implemented a two-phased approach to evaluate the use of SRC in our newborn nursery. Phase 1 utilized a retrospective review of cases with SRC superimposition. If results from Phase 1 were found to be favorable, Phase 2 initiated a trial of the SRC for a six-month period prior to complete implementation. Methods Phase 1 consisted of retrospectively applying the SRC to electronic medical records (EMR) of infants ≥ 35 weeks' gestational age admitted to the newborn nursery with risk factors for EONS between June 2016 and May 2017. We compared actual antibiotic use as determined by the unit's EONS protocol for evaluation and management based on 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and AAP guidelines to SRC-recommended antibiotic use. We used EMR to determine maternal and infant data, blood work results, and antibiotic usage as well as used daily progress notes by the clinical team to determine the clinical status of the infants retrospectively. Based on the projected reduction in blood work and antibiotics use with the retrospective superimposition of SRC on this cohort of infants and identification of our high-risk patient subset, we developed a novel, hybrid EONS protocol that we implemented and assessed throughout Phase 2, a six-month period from August 2018 to January 2019, as a prospective observational study. Results Phase 1 (SRC superimposition) demonstrated that the use of the SRC would have reduced empiric antibiotic use from 56% to 13% in the study cohort when compared with 2010 CDC/AAP guidelines. However, these same findings revealed use of the SRC would have resulted in delayed evaluation and initiation of antibiotics in 2 of 4 chorioamnionitis-exposed infants with positive blood cultures. During Phase 2 (n=302), with the implementation of our tailored approach (SRC implementation with additional blood culture in chorioamnionitis-exposed infants), 12 (4%) neonates received empiric antibiotic treatment compared to nine (3%) neonates who would have been treated per strict adherence to SRC recommendations. No neonate had culture-positive EONS. Continued use of 2010 CDC/AAP guidelines would have led to empiric antibiotic use in 38 (12.6%) infants in this cohort. Conclusion We developed a novel hybrid approach to the evaluation and management of neonates at increased risk of EONS by tailoring SRC recommendations to our safety-net population. Our stewardship effort achieved a safe and significant reduction in antibiotic usage compared to prior usage determined using CDC/AAP guidelines.",Cureus,2023,Sfurti Nath; Rana Alissa; Samarth Shukla; Meng Li; Carmen Smotherman; Mark L Hudak,[],"['antibiotic stewardship', 'early onset neonatal sepsis', 'early onset sepsis', 'neonate', 'new born', 'sepsis risk calculator']",3
37048786,Patterns of Infections among Extremely Preterm Infants.,"Infections remain a leading cause of neonatal death, especially among the extremely preterm infants. To evaluate the incidence, pathogenesis, and in-hospital outcomes associated with sepsis among hospitalized extremely preterm infants born at 24-0/7 to 27-6/7 weeks of gestation, we designed a post hoc analysis of data collected prospectively during the Preterm Epo Neuroprotection (PENUT) Trial, NCT #01378273. We analyzed culture positive infection data, as well as type and duration of antibiotic course and described their association with in-hospital morbidities and mortality. Of 936 included infants, 229 (24%) had at least one positive blood culture during their hospitalization. Early onset sepsis (EOS, ≤3 days after birth) occurred in 6% of the infants, with Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS) and Escherichia Coli the most frequent pathogens. Late onset sepsis (LOS, >day 3) occurred in 20% of the infants. Nearly all infants were treated with antibiotics for presumed sepsis at least once during their hospitalization. The risk of confirmed or presumed EOS was lower with increasing birthweight. Confirmed EOS had no significant association with in-hospital outcomes or death while LOS was associated with increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis and death. Extremely premature infants with presumed sepsis as compared to culture positive sepsis had lower rates of morbidities. In conclusion, the use of antibiotics for presumed sepsis remains much higher than confirmed infection rates. Ongoing work exploring antibiotic stewardship and presumed, culture-negative sepsis in extremely preterm infants is needed.",Journal of clinical medicine,2023,Krystle Perez; Mihai Puia-Dumitrescu; Bryan A Comstock; Thomas R Wood; Dennis E Mayock; Patrick J Heagerty; Sandra E Juul; On Behalf Of The Penut Consortium,[],"['exposure to antibiotics', 'extremely preterm infants', 'neonatal infections', 'sepsis']",3

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance profile of Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) isolated from the surgical environment. All samples were collected during the intraoperative period of clean/clean-contaminated (G1) and contaminated (G2) surgery. A total of 150 samples were collected from the superficial surgical site in the beginning (n = 30) and the end (n = 30) of the procedure, surgeon's hands before (n = 30) and after (n = 30) antisepsis, and the surgical environment (n = 30). MALDI-TOF MS and antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disk diffusion method were performed for species identification, and determination of the resistance profile. Sixty-eight isolates of GPC and 15 of GNB were obtained. Staphylococcus spp. were the most frequent species isolated from surgical site (55.26% [21/38]), surgeon's hands (46.15% [6/13]), and environment (56.67% [17/30]). GPC were mostly resistance to penicillin (85.71% [54/63]), and erythromycin (77.78% [49/63]), and GNB were mostly resistance to cefazolin (58.33% [7/12]), and azithromycin (58.33% [7/12]). High incidence of multidrug resistance was observed in coagulase-negative staphylococci (86.21% [25/29]), coagulase-positive staphylococci (86.67% [13/15]), Enterococcus spp. (68.42% [13/19]) and Gram-negative bacilli (60% [9/15]).

28961725,A framework for ensuring a balanced accounting of the impact of antimicrobial stewardship interventions.,"Drawing on a Cochrane systematic review, this paper examines the relatively limited range of outcomes measured in published evaluations of antimicrobial stewardship interventions (ASIs) in hospitals. We describe a structured framework for considering the range of consequences that ASIs can have, in terms of their desirability and the extent to which they were expected when planning an ASI: expected, desirable consequences (intervention goals); expected, undesirable consequences (intervention trade-offs); unexpected, undesirable consequences (unpleasant surprises); and unexpected, desirable consequences (pleasant surprises). Of 49 randomized controlled trials identified by the Cochrane review, 28 (57%) pre-specified increased length of stay and/or mortality as potential trade-offs of ASI, with measurement intended to provide reassurance about safety. In actuality, some studies found unexpected decreases in length of stay (a pleasant surprise). In contrast, only 11 (10%) of 110 interrupted time series studies included any information about unintended consequences, with 10 examining unexpected, undesirable outcomes (unpleasant surprises) using case-control, qualitative or cohort designs. Overall, a large proportion of the ASIs reported in the literature only assess impact on their targeted process goals-antimicrobial prescribing-with limited examination of other potential outcomes, including microbial and clinical outcomes. Achieving a balanced accounting of the impact of an ASI requires careful consideration of expected undesirable effects (potential trade-offs) from the outset, and more consideration of unexpected effects after implementation (both pleasant and unpleasant surprises, although the latter will often be more important). The proposed framework supports the systematic consideration of all types of consequences of improvement before and after implementation.",The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,2017,Madalina Toma; Peter G Davey; Charis A Marwick; Bruce Guthrie,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Health Services Research', 'Humans', 'Interrupted Time Series Analysis', 'Length of Stay', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",[],3

DESIGN Prospective noninferiority before-and-after study comparing 2 periods: January 1, 2012, to January 31, 2014 (the CP period) and February 1, 2014, to February 29, 2016 (the SP period). SETTING A 16-bed polyvalent ICU in France with only single-bed rooms with dedicated equipment and reusable medical devices. PATIENTS All patients admitted to the ICU during the CP and SP periods were included: 1,547 and 1,577 patients, respectively. METHODS Incidence densities of ICU-acquired MRSA or ESBLE were determined per 1,000 patient days. Other studied factors included (1) patient characteristics, (2) incidence densities of MRSA or ESBLE carried at admission, (3) compliance with hand hygiene protocols, and (4) antibiotic consumption. RESULTS Incidence densities of ICU-acquired MRSA were 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-1.33) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.30-1.29) per 1,000 patient days during the CP and SP periods, respectively. For ESBLE, values were 2.7 (95% CI, 1.78-3.62) and 2.06 (95% CI, 1.27-2.86) per 1,000 patient days. These rates were significantly nonsuperior during the SP period compared to CP period, with a margin of 1 per 1,000 patient days for both MRSA (P=.002) and ESBLE (P=.004). Other factors were comparable during the 2 periods. Only ESBLE carried at admission was inferior during the SP period. We observed a high level of compliance to hand hygiene protocols. CONCLUSIONS Discontinuing CP did not increase acquired MRSA and ESBLE in our ICU with single rooms with dedicated equipment, strict application of hand hygiene, medical and paramedical leadership, and good antibiotic stewardship.

DESIGN Interrupted time series. SETTING Academic pediatric hospital with separate oncology and HSCT services. PARTICIPANTS Children admitted to the services during baseline (October 2011-August 2013) and 2 intervention periods, September 2013-June 2015 and July 2015-June 2016, including 1,525 oncology hospitalizations and 301 HSCT hospitalizations. INTERVENTION In phase 1, we completed an update of the institutional febrile neutropenia (FN) guideline for the pediatric oncology service, recommending first-line β-lactam monotherapy rather than routine use of 2 gram-negative agents. Phase 2 included updating the HSCT service FN guideline and engagement with a new pediatric antimicrobial stewardship program. The use of target antibiotics (tobramycin and ciprofloxacin) was measured in days of therapy per 1,000 patient days collected from administrative data. Intervention effects were evaluated using interrupted time series with segmented regression. RESULTS Phase 1 had mixed effects-long-term reduction in tobramycin use (97% below projected at 18 months) but rebound with increasing slope in ciprofloxacin use (+18% per month). Following phase 2, tobramycin and ciprofloxacin use on the oncology service were both 99% below projected levels at 12 months. On the HSCT service, tobramycin use was 99% below the projected level and ciprofloxacin use was 96% below the projected level at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS Locally adapted guidelines can facilitate practice changes in oncology and HSCT settings.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of the incidence rate of hospital-onset carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) infection (per 1000 patient days) in the Queen Mary Hospital, a 1700-bed, university-affiliated teaching hospital, from period 1 (1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013) to period 2 (1 January 2014 to 31 December 2019), where enhanced infection control measures, including directly observed hand hygiene before meal and medication rounds to conscious patients, and the priority use of single room isolation, were implemented during period 2. This study aimed to investigate the association between enhanced infection control measures and changes in the trend in the incidence rate of hospital-onset CRAB infection. Antimicrobial consumption (defined daily dose per 1000 patient days) was monitored. Interrupted time series, in particular segmented Poisson regression, was used. The hospital-onset CRAB infection increased by 21.3% per year [relative risk (RR): 1.213, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.162−1.266, p < 0.001], whereas the consumption of the extended spectrum betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor (BLBI) combination and cephalosporins increased by 11.2% per year (RR: 1.112, 95% CI: 1.102−1.122, p < 0.001) and 4.2% per year (RR: 1.042, 95% CI: 1.028−1.056, p < 0.001), respectively, in period 1. With enhanced infection control measures, the hospital-onset CRAB infection decreased by 9.8% per year (RR: 0.902, 95% CI: 0.854−0.953, p < 0.001), whereas the consumption of the extended spectrum BLBI combination and cephalosporins increased by 3.8% per year (RR: 1.038, 95% CI: 1.033−1.044, p < 0.001) and 7.6% per year (RR: 1.076, 95% CI: 1.056−1.097, p < 0.001), respectively, in period 2.

With a few exceptions, standard-of-care diagnostics are too slow to influence initial decisions on antimicrobial therapy. The management of CAP is therefore largely based on empirical treatment guidelines. Empiric antimicrobial therapy is often initiated in the primary care setting, affecting diagnostic tests based on conventional bacterial culture in hospitalized patients.

35378064,The impact of diagnostic stewardship interventions on Clostridiodes difficile test ordering practices and results.,"Clostridiodes difficile infection (CDI) is a leading cause of healthcare associated infection and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Diagnostic stewardship is critical in optimizing testing accuracy for CDI. Multiple algorithms have been used for testing combining toxin A/B, glutamate dehydrogenase antigen and nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) to enhance sensitivity. This study evaluated the effectiveness of two interventions on the rates and appropriateness of Clostridiodes difficile test orders and hospital-onset (HO) CDI. All Clostridiodes difficile orders and results in the study period (1/2018-2/2021) were included. To evaluate ordering appropriateness, we reviewed the medical charts of a random subsample of 100 orders that were collected from three periods within the study: pre-intervention and following each intervention. The first intervention was a clinical decision support system (CDSS) tool guiding providers to order testing only if CDI clinical criteria were met. The second intervention eliminated automatic NAAT reflex for indeterminate results and required antimicrobial stewardship team approval. A total of 3004 orders were registered during the study period. There was a 33% reduction in the rates of Clostridiodes difficile orders by the end of the study period (p < 0.001). The rates of reportable HO-CDI were significantly reduced by 57.1% (p = 0.003). We also noted a trend of increased appropriateness of testing overtime. In conclusion, combining CDSS intervention with NAAT reflex restriction was an effective tool to reduce inappropriate Clostridiodes difficile orders and decrease the rates of reportable HO-CDI.",Clinical biochemistry,2023,Joshua Khuvis; Majd Alsoubani; Angie Mae Rodday; Shira Doron,"['Humans', 'Clostridioides difficile', 'Clostridium Infections', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques', 'Cross Infection', 'Algorithms']","['C. difficile', 'Clostridiodes difficile', 'Diagnostic stewardship intervention', 'NAAT reflex', 'PCR and toxin testing', 'PCR reflex']",3
35251792,Evaluation of the Potential Impact of a Multiplex Rapid Diagnostic Panel in Critically Ill Patients With Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia.,"Background Rapid diagnostic tools have emerged as valuable assets assisting clinicians in decision-making regarding patient management in the hospital setting. Our study sought to identify the potential impact of the BioFire® FilmArray® Pneumonia Panel (FP Panel) (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) in patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Methods Respiratory samples obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or tracheal aspiration (TA) from ICU patients with a diagnosis of HAP were tested by the FP panel in addition to routine bacterial cultures. In addition, the electronic health records of these patients were reviewed to determine what potential changes in antimicrobial therapy could have been implemented if the panel results were known to the treatment team in real-time. A cost analysis was also performed incorporating the cost of the pneumonia panel and the savings associated with the potential decrease of antibiotic use and avoidance of the rapid viral diagnostic panel.  Results Fifty-six patients met the study criteria. The FP panel results could have prompted a change in therapy in 36 (64.3%) patients, with an anticipated mean reduction in time to optimized therapy of approximately 51 hours. In addition, the panel identified three cases where antimicrobials should have been altered because patients were not receiving empiric therapy with activity against the causative pathogen and 34 opportunities for antibiotic de-escalation. The cost analysis calculated an additional cost of $10 per patient associated with using the FP panel.  Conclusions The FP panel could have prompted a change in therapy in about two-thirds of patients studied. Its potential benefits include a more rapid time to optimized therapy, reduced exposure to and cost of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, and reduced cost of other rapid diagnostic tests.",Cureus,2022,Bradley J Erich; Abdullah Kilic; Elizabeth Palavecino; John Williamson; James Johnson; Christopher Ohl; Vera Luther; James Beardsley,[],"['diagnostic stewardship', 'filmarray pneumonia panel', 'hospital-acquired pneumonia', 'pcr', 'rapid diagnostic tests']",3

36758108,Reduction strategies for inpatient oral third-generation cephalosporins at a cancer center: An interrupted time-series analysis.,"Oral third-generation cephalosporins (3GCs) are not recommended for use owing to their low bioavailability and the risk of emergence of resistant microorganisms with overuse. A standardized and effective method for reducing their use is lacking. Here, in a 60-month, single-institution, interrupted time-series analysis, which was retrospectively conducted between April 1, 2017, and March 31, 2022, we evaluated the effectiveness of a four-phase intervention to reduce the use of 3GCs in patients at a cancer center: Phase 1 (pre-intervention), Phase 2 (review of clinical pathways), Phase 3 (establishment of infectious disease consultation service and implementation of antimicrobial stewardship program), and Phase 4 (educational lecture and pop-up displays for oral antimicrobials at the time of ordering). Although no significant changes were observed in Phases 3 and 4, the first intervention resulted in a significant decrease in the trend and level of days of therapy (DOT) for 3GCs. The level for cephalexin DOT and the trend for sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim DOT increased in Phase 4, and the trend for amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate DOT increased in Phase 3. Macrolide DOT showed a decreasing trend in Phases 2 and 4 and decreasing and increased levels in Phases 3 and 4, respectively; no change was observed for quinolones. Actual and adjusted purchase costs of 3GCs decreased significantly during all study periods, while those for oral antimicrobials decreased in Phase 2, and actual purchase costs increased in Phases 3 and 4. No significant reduction in resistant organisms, length of hospital stay, or mortality was observed. This is the first study on the effects of oral 3GC reduction strategies in patients with cancer. We conclude that even facilities that substantially use antimicrobials can efficiently reduce the use of 3GCs.",PloS one,2023,Naoya Itoh; Takanori Kawabata; Nana Akazawa; Daichi Kawamura; Hiromi Murakami; Yuichi Ishibana; Eiichi N Kodama; Norio Ohmagari,"['Humans', 'Cephalosporins', 'Inpatients', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Amoxicillin-Potassium Clavulanate Combination', 'Neoplasms']",[],3

We implemented multidisciplinary tele-COVID rounds plus tele-antibiotic stewardship surveillance in 17 SCHs to standardize COVID management and evaluate concurrent antibiotics for discontinuation. Antibiotic use was compared in the 4 months preintervention versus 10 months postintervention. Interrupted time-series analysis demonstrated an immediate decrease in antibiotic use by 339 days of therapy/1000 COVID-19 patient days (p < .001), and an estimated 5258 antibiotic days avoided during the postintervention period. Thirty-day mortality was not significantly different, and a significant reduction in transfers was observed following the intervention (23.3% vs. 7.8%, p < .001).

37125081,Estimating treatment effects for time-to-treatment antibiotic stewardship in sepsis.,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with a high in-hospital mortality rate. The timing of antibiotic administration poses a critical problem for sepsis management. Existing work studying antibiotic timing either ignores the temporality of the observational data or the heterogeneity of the treatment effects. Here we propose a novel method (called T4) to estimate treatment effects for time-to-treatment antibiotic stewardship in sepsis. T4 estimates individual treatment effects by recurrently encoding temporal and static variables as potential confounders, and then decoding the outcomes under different treatment sequences. We propose mini-batch balancing matching that mimics the randomized controlled trial process to adjust the confounding. The model achieves interpretability through a global-level attention mechanism and a variable-level importance examination. Meanwhile, we equip T4 with an uncertainty quantification to help prevent overconfident recommendations. We demonstrate that T4 can identify effective treatment timing with estimated individual treatment effects for antibiotic stewardship on two real-world datasets. Moreover, comprehensive experiments on a synthetic dataset exhibit the outstanding performance of T4 compared with the state-of-the-art models on estimation of individual treatment effect.",Nature machine intelligence,2023,Ruoqi Liu; Katherine M Hunold; Jeffrey M Caterino; Ping Zhang,[],[],3

40181450,Reserve antibiotics: overcoming limitations of evidence generated from regulatory approval trials.,"New antibiotics active against multidrug resistant bacteria (MDR-B) are licensed by regulatory agencies based on pivotal trials that serve the primary purpose of obtaining marketing-authorization. There is increasing concern that they do not offer guidance on how to best use new antibiotics, in which population, and to what extent they overcome existing resistance. We reviewed the literature for pre-approval studies (phase 2 and 3 randomized controlled trials) and post-approval studies (randomized and non-randomized controlled trials) evaluating efficacy and safety of new antibiotics, classified by WHO as Reserve, approved in the European Union and the US from January 2010 to May 2023. Substantial failures occur in generating evidence to guide routine clinical use: preapproval studies lack representativeness, select outcomes and comparators to chase statistical significance, and often avoid using prespecified analytical methods. Three recommendations are key to enhance the quality and relevance of clinical data underpinning use of last resort molecules on the WHO AWaRe Reserve list active against carbapenem-resistant MDR-B i). separation of pivotal trials from post-approval studies, which should be funded by public programs and de-linked from commercial purposes, ii). development and maintenance of a global infrastructure to conduct post-approval public health focused studies, and iii). development of trial platforms that use efficient, adaptive designs to inform clinical decision making and country level technology appraisal.

This retrospective, quasi-experiment evaluated adult and pediatric patients with suspected ME, evidenced by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture. Hospital-acquired meningitis patients and patients who received antimicrobials >48 h prior to lumbar puncture were excluded. The primary endpoint was days of antimicrobial therapy pre- and post-implementation of the ME panel. Secondary endpoints included total length of stay, 30-day readmission, and individual days of antimicrobial therapy. Two hundred and sixty-four total adult and pediatric patients were included. Antimicrobial days of therapy had a median of 3 days (IQR 0−5) in the pre vs. post group with a median of 2 days (2−5) (p = 0.099). Days of therapy for acyclovir were significantly decreased in the post group (median 2 days [IQR 1−3] vs. 3 days [IQR 2.5−4.5], p = 0.0002). There were no significant differences in the secondary endpoints. Overall, implementation of the ME panel impacted the duration of antimicrobials, particularly acyclovir; however, opportunities for further education regarding antimicrobial de-escalation and utilization of the panel were identified.

Our objective was to evaluate whether rapid determination of methicillin resistance shortens the time from Gram stain to targeted antimicrobial therapy in staphylococcal bacteraemia, thereby reducing vancomycin overuse. This was a single-centre open parallel RCT. Gram-positive cocci in clusters in positive blood culture underwent real-time PCR for rapid species and methicillin resistance determination parallel to conventional microbiology. Patients were randomized 1:1 so that clinicians would be informed of PCR results (intervention group) or not (control group). Eighty-nine patients (intervention 48, control 41) were analysed. MRSA was identified in seven patients, MSSA in 46, and CoNS in 36. PCR results were highly concordant (87/89) with standard microbiology. Median time (hours) from Gram stain to transmission of methicillin-susceptibility was 3.9 (2.8-4.3) vs. 25.4 (24.4-26-7) in intervention vs. control groups (p <0.001). Median time (hours) from Gram stain to targeted treatment was similar for 'all staphylococci' [6 (3.8-10) vs. 8 (1-36) p 0.13] but shorter in the intervention group when considering S. aureus only [5 (3-7) vs. 25.5 (3.8-54) p <0.001]. When standard susceptibility testing was complete, 41/48 (85.4%) patients in the intervention group were already receiving targeted therapy compared with 23/41 (56.1%) in the control group (p 0.004).

These methods may be particularly useful for the identification of the causative agent(s) in cases of aspiration pneumonia, in which there is usually prior administration of antibiotics. The most common empirical treatment of aspiration pneumonia is the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics; however, this may result in negative cultures from specimens taken from the respiratory tract. Therefore, in such cases, polymerase chain reaction or metagenomic next-generation sequencing may be life-saving. Moreover, these modern molecular methods may assist with antimicrobial stewardship. Based upon factors such as age, altered mental consciousness and recent hospitalization, there is a shift towards the predominance of aerobes, especially Gram-negative bacteria, over anaerobes in aspiration pneumonia. Thus, the therapeutic choices should be expanded to cover multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria in selected cases of aspiration pneumonia.","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Natalia G Vallianou; Alexandros Skourtis; Dimitris Kounatidis; Evangelia Margellou; Fotis Panagopoulos; Eleni Geladari; Angelos Evangelopoulos; Edison Jahaj,[],"['PCR', 'gram negative bacteria', 'lung microbiome', 'mNGS']",3

30253915,Implementation of an empirical antimicrobial protocol in a critical care setting: A single-center retrospective observational cohort study in bacteremic patients.,"In the treatment of severe infections in critical care settings, the selection of initial empirical antimicrobials affects patient outcomes and antimicrobial overuse. The application of a comprehensive treatment guidance might facilitate appropriate antimicrobial selection. Therefore, we developed such an antimicrobial guidance for use in emergency and critical care center and verified its efficacy. We retrospectively analyzed the data of 195 patients (96 patients before guidance introduction [control group] and 99 after guidance introduction [intervention group]) who were ultimately diagnosed with bacteremia to assess the effects of the guidance (the intervention). The appropriateness of the empirical therapy was greater in the intervention than in the control group (96% vs. 90%, respectively; P = 0.10). Moreover, the rate of carbapenem use was significantly lower in the intervention than in the control group (6% vs. 20%, respectively; P < 0.01). The control and intervention groups had similar 28-day survival rates of 81% and 85%, respectively; P = 0.50). These findings imply that introducing an empirical antimicrobial guidance in emergency outpatient and emergency intensive care settings could improve antimicrobial stewardship without affecting patient mortality.

As bacterial infections are a common cause for treatment-related mortality in these patients, we conducted a retrospective study to analyze the incidence of CDI and to evaluate risk factors for CDI in a large uniformly treated AML cohort. A total of 415 AML patients undergoing intensive induction chemotherapy between 2007 and 2019 were included in this retrospective analysis. Patients presenting with diarrhea and positive stool testing for toxin-producing Clostridioides difficile were defined to have CDI. CDI was diagnosed in 37 (8.9%) of 415 AML patients with decreasing CDI rates between 2013 and 2019 versus 2007 to 2012. Days with fever, exposition to carbapenems, and glycopeptides were significantly associated with CDI in AML patients. Clinical endpoints such as length of hospital stay, admission to ICU, response rates, and survival were not adversely affected. We identified febrile episodes and exposition to carbapenems and glycopeptides as risk factors for CDI in AML patients undergoing induction chemotherapy, thereby highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary antibiotic stewardship programs guiding treatment strategies in AML patients with infectious complications to carefully balance risks and benefits of anti-infective agents.",Annals of hematology,2020,Olivier Ballo; Eva-Maria Kreisel; Fagr Eladly; Uta Brunnberg; Jan Stratmann; Peter Hunyady; Michael Hogardt; Thomas A Wichelhaus; Volkhard A J Kempf; Björn Steffen; Joerg J Vehreschild; Maria J G T Vehreschild; Fabian Finkelmeier; Hubert Serve; Christian H Brandts,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carbapenems', 'Clostridioides difficile', 'Enterocolitis, Pseudomembranous', 'Female', 'Glycopeptides', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']","['AML', 'CDI', 'Induction chemotherapy']",3

Several randomized controlled trials, including adult critically ill patients, showed that PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship was repeatedly associated with a decrease in the duration of antibiotic therapy with no apparent harm. There are however some relevant limitations in these trials namely the low rate of compliance of PCT-guided algorithms, the high rate of exclusion (without including common clinical situations and pathogens) and the long duration of antibiotic therapy in control groups. Such limitations weakened the real impact of such algorithms in the clinical decision-making process and strengthened the concept that the initiation and the duration of antibiotic therapy cannot depend solely on a biomarker. Future efforts should address these limitations in order to better clarify the role of biomarkers on the complex and multifactorial issue of antibiotic management and to deeply understand its potential effect on mortality.",Annals of translational medicine,2017,David Nora; Jorge Salluh; Ignacio Martin-Loeches; Pedro Póvoa,[],"['Biomarkers', 'C-reactive protein (CRP)', 'antibiotic', 'infection', 'procalcitonin (PCT)']",3

A quasi-experimental interrupted time-series study was performed from 2011 to 2022. An educational ASP was implemented at the EDOU in 2015. To estimate changes in antimicrobial use, we designed an indicator adjusted for patients at risk of antimicrobial prescribing: defined daily doses (DDDs) per 100 patients transferred from the Emergency Department to the Observation Unit (TOs) per quarter. The number of bloodstream infections (BSIs) and the crude all-cause 14-day mortality were assessed as clinical outcomes. Antimicrobial use showed a sustained reduction with a trend change of -1.17 DDD per 100 TO and a relative effect of -45.6% (CI95% -64.5 to -26.7), particularly relevant for meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam, with relative effects of -80.4% (-115.0 to -45.7) and -67.9% (-93.9 to -41.9), respectively. The incidence density of all BSIs increased significantly during the ASP period, with a relative effect of 123.2% (41.3 to 284.7). The mortality rate remained low and stable throughout the study period, with an absolute effect of -0.7% (-16.0 to 14.7). The regular monitoring of antimicrobial use in the EDOU by using this new quantitative indicator was useful to demonstrate that an institutional education-based ASP successfully achieved a long-term reduction in overall antimicrobial use, with a low and steady BSI mortality rate.","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,Ana Belén Guisado-Gil; Marta Mejías-Trueba; Germán Peñalva; Manuela Aguilar-Guisado; Jose Molina; Adelina Gimeno; Rocío Álvarez-Marín; Julia Praena; Claudio Bueno; José Antonio Lepe; María Victoria Gil-Navarro; José Miguel Cisneros,[],"['Emergency Department', 'antimicrobial agents', 'antimicrobial stewardship', 'bloodstream infection', 'health metrics']",3

While therapeutic interventions are available for both (for e.g. antibiotics), a major dilemma is early diagnosis so that these interventions can be done in a timely manner. As clinical evaluation alone is unreliable in identifying infants in the early stages of neonatal sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis, there is a need to find specific biomarkers associated with these conditions to improve diagnostic capabilities. Optimal use of biomarkers in the identification and management of affected neonates requires an understanding of the properties of each marker within the timeline of the inflammatory response. We propose that early- and mid-phase markers such as neutrophil CD64 and procalcitonin should be combined with the late-phase biomarker C-reactive protein for maximal diagnostic benefit. Appropriately powered trials evaluating the serial measurements of these markers in decisions related to antibiotic stewardship in the neonatal population are indicated, in addition to more studies investigating other potentially useful biomarkers.",Early human development,2017,Margaret Gilfillan; Vineet Bhandari,"['Biomarkers', 'Enterocolitis, Necrotizing', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Neonatal Sepsis', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic']",[],3

Once an organism is isolated, antimicrobial susceptibility results (phenotypic testing) can take another day. A rapid diagnostic test identifying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes could help clinicians make earlier, informed antimicrobial decisions. Here we aimed to validate a custom AMR gene TaqMan Array Card (AMR-TAC) for the first time and assess its feasibility as a screening tool in critically ill children. An AMR-TAC was developed using a combination of commercial and bespoke targets capable of detecting 23 AMR genes. This was validated using isolates with known phenotypic resistance. The card was then tested on lower respiratory tract and faecal samples obtained from mechanically ventilated children in a single-centre observational study of respiratory infection. There were 82 children with samples available, with a median age of 1.2 years. Major comorbidity was present in 29 (35%) children. A bacterial respiratory pathogen was identified in 13/82 (16%) of children, of which 4/13 (31%) had phenotypic AMR. One AMR gene was detected in 49/82 (60%), and multiple AMR genes were detected in 14/82 (17%) children. Most AMR gene detections were not associated with the identification of phenotypic AMR. AMR genes are commonly detected in samples collected from mechanically ventilated children with suspected respiratory infections. AMR-TAC may have a role as an adjunct test in selected children in whom there is a high suspicion of antimicrobial treatment failure.","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,John A Clark; Martin D Curran; Theodore Gouliouris; Andrew Conway Morris; Rachel Bousfield; Vilas Navapurkar; Iain R L Kean; Esther Daubney; Deborah White; Stephen Baker; Nazima Pathan,[],"['antibacterial agents', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'child', 'critical illness', 'rapid diagnostic tests', 'respiratory system']",3

29715176,Procalcitonin guidance in patients with lower respiratory tract infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Although effective for bacterial lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), antibiotic treatment is often incorrectly prescribed for non-bacterial LRTIs. Procalcitonin has emerged as a promising biomarker to diagnose bacterial infections and guide antibiotic treatment decisions. As part of a regulatory submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, this systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the effects of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic stewardship on antibiotic use and clinical outcomes in adult LRTI patients. PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for English-language randomized controlled trials published between January 2004 and May 2016. Random and fixed effects meta-analyses were performed to study efficacy (initiation of antibiotics, antibiotic use) and safety (mortality, length of hospital stay). Eleven trials were retained, comprising 4090 patients. Procalcitonin-guided patients had lower odds of antibiotic initiation (odds ratio: 0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13-0.52) and shorter mean antibiotic use (weighted mean difference: -2.15 days; 95% CI: -3.30 to -0.99) compared to patients treated with standard care. Procalcitonin use had no adverse impact on mortality (relative risk: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.69-1.28) and length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference: -0.15 days; 95% CI: -0.60 to 0.30). Procalcitonin guidance reduces antibiotic initiation and use among adults with LRTIs with no apparent adverse impact on length of hospital stay or mortality.",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,2018,Juliane Hey; Philippe Thompson-Leduc; Noam Y Kirson; Louise Zimmer; Dana Wilkins; Bernie Rice; Irena Iankova; Alexander Krause; Sophie A Schonfeld; Christopher R DeBrase; Samuel Bozzette; Philipp Schuetz,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biomarkers', 'Drug Misuse', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Procalcitonin', 'Respiratory Tract Infections']","['antibiotics', 'biomarker', 'bronchitis', 'calcitonin', 'pneumonia', 'procalcitonin']",3

This study evaluated the broad-spectrum antimicrobial use before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in an acute tertiary-care hospital. Methods This single-center, retrospective study was conducted between January 2019 and June 2021. Patients We reviewed patients treated with three broad-spectrum antipseudomonal agents: carbapenems, tazobactam/piperacillin, and cefepime. Monthly aggregated hospital antimicrobial consumption was measured as days of therapy (DOTs) per 1,000 patient-days, and the monthly incidences of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MRPA), and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) were recorded. Results The median monthly carbapenem-DOTs during the pre-pandemic and pandemic era were 8.4 and 8.2 per 1,000 patient-days, respectively. A time-series analysis showed non-significant changes in the level between periods (coefficients: 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.9 to 7.0; p=0.44). No change in the trend of monthly carbapenem-DOTs was observed after intervention. No post-intervention changes in the incidence of MRPA or CPE were observed; however, the trend in the incidence of CDI per 1,000 patient-days significantly differed between the two periods (coefficient: -0.04; 95% CI: -0.07, 0.00; p=0.01), and a downward trend was observed in the monthly CDI incidence during the COVID-19 period. Conclusion The consumption of broad intravenous antimicrobial agents has not changed significantly during the pandemic. We need to maintain the quality of medical care, including antimicrobial stewardship, even in specialized resource-limited facilities during a pandemic.","Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2024,Yoshiro Hadano; Kazuhiro Ohwaki; Asuka Suyama; Ayako Miura; Shigeo Fujii; Yoshiko Suzuki; Yoshitaka Tomoda; Yukikazu Awaya,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Carbapenems', 'Cefepime', 'COVID-19', 'Drug Utilization', 'East Asian People', 'Incidence', 'Interrupted Time Series Analysis', 'Japan', 'Piperacillin, Tazobactam Drug Combination', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tertiary Care Centers']","['antimicrobial resistance', 'antimicrobial stewardship program', 'coronavirus disease 2019', 'pandemic']",3
40932534,Microbiological diagnostics and their impact on hematology nursing.,"Microbiological diagnostics have become a foundational element in hematology nursing, where early and accurate infection detection is vital for immunocompromised patients. This review explores how both traditional techniques, such as microscopy, culture, and antigen detection, and emerging technologies, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, contribute to clinical decision-making and infection control. These tools not only accelerate pathogen identification and resistance profiling but also support precision medicine approaches tailored to hematologic patient needs. The expanding role of hematology nurses is emphasized, particularly in diagnostic stewardship, specimen collection, result interpretation, and coordination of infection management strategies. Educational interventions have proven effective in reducing contamination rates and improving antimicrobial targeting. Furthermore, novel point-of-care platforms, such as CRISPR-based diagnostics and AI-enhanced digital PCR, are shifting diagnostic capabilities closer to the bedside, redefining nursing workflows and responsibilities. These innovations empower nurses to engage in real-time clinical decisions, monitor therapy responses, and enhance patient education regarding diagnostic procedures and infection risks. However, gaps remain in microbiology-related training and confidence among nurses, highlighting the need for integrated educational curricula and interdisciplinary collaboration. By aligning technological advancements with frontline nursing practice, microbiological diagnostics not only optimize patient outcomes but also elevate the role of nurses as key stakeholders in infection prevention, antimicrobial stewardship, and evidence-based care. This review underscores the urgent need to equip hematology nurses with the skills and tools necessary to adapt to the rapidly evolving diagnostic landscape in order to support safe, timely, and personalized healthcare delivery.",Folia microbiologica,2025,Fang Wang; Jinling Xia; Jia Sun,[],"['Antimicrobial stewardship', 'Hematologic diseases', 'Infection control', 'Molecular diagnostic techniques', 'Nursing']",3

Another concern facing physicians is rising global incidence of drug-resistant Candida. This study aimed to characterize the prevalence, antifungal susceptibility, biofilm formation, and virulence genes (HWP1, ALS1, SAP2) of different Candida spp. isolated from patients with candidemia. 52 isolates of Candida spp. were identified from blood cultures by chromogenic Candida agar and confirmed by the VITEK 2 system. Isolates were tested for antifungal susceptibility by disk diffusion and VITEK 2 system. Biofilm formation and investigated genes were detected by the Congo red method and conventional PCR, respectively. Candida spp. caused 2.3% of detected BSIs, of which 32.7% were caused by Candida albicans (C. albicans) and 67.3% by non-albicans Candida (NAC), with the predominance of C. tropicalis (25%), followed by C. parapsilosis (17.3%), and C. krusei (13.5%).

41067487,Sepsis diagnosis and monitoring: Frontiers in innovative technology.,"One of the most common hospital-associated infections, especially in the ICU, is sepsis, and its early detection is a significant issue that health care systems must contend with. Effective treatment of sepsis requires early diagnosis and rapid therapeutic intervention. The early detection of this life-threatening condition is significantly improved not only by identifying drug-resistant pathogens but also by detecting unique immune response biomarkers that arise upon pathogen invasion, thus creating a critical early warning system. The methodology involves advanced molecular diagnostic tools, such as real-time PCR, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and novel biomarker detection platforms. These methods enable faster identification of pathogens and biomarkers, enhancing the accuracy and speed of sepsis diagnosis. We also discuss the integration of these technologies with clinical workflows, considering their impact on patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency. In this paper, we review novel and rapid sepsis diagnostic techniques compared to traditional methods, emphasizing the significance and efficiency of the emerging technologies. An extensive review of the literature was conducted through databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar with keywords such as ""sepsis"" and ""diagnostic strategies"" to identify the most suitable articles for this review. Effective management of sepsis, a complex and deadly disease, relies on knowledge and application of rapid diagnostic techniques, such as new analytic tools, for successful treatment and improved patient outcomes. Advanced molecular diagnosis and clinical trials are maximizing therapeutic control with biomarker tracking (sTREM-1, IL-6, PCT) and improving diagnostic accuracy. Introducing new technologies in molecular diagnosis, analysis, and clinical management is crucial to improve septic shock patient outcomes. Our review highlights that while traditional methods such as blood culture remain essential, they are limited by long turnaround times and reduced sensitivity. Rapid molecular assays (PCR, MALDI-TOF) and biosensor-based point-of-care platforms provide results within hours, enabling earlier targeted treatment. Among biomarkers, procalcitonin remains the most established, but newer candidates such as presepsin, CXCL5, and circRNAs show promising diagnostic and prognostic potential. Integrating these innovative technologies into clinical workflows can enhance early detection, support antimicrobial stewardship, and ultimately improve patient survival.",Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,2025,Seyedeh Azin Mirmotahari; Armin Salek Maghsoudi; Masoomeh Amini; Mojdeh Safari; Mohammad Akrami; Seyed Iman Mirnezami; Atabak Najafi; Parisa Kianpour; Mojtaba Mojtahedzadeh; Shokoufeh Hassani,[],"['Biosensor', 'Point-of-care', 'Rapid diagnostic technologies', 'Sepsis', 'biomarker', 'infection']",3

Timely diagnosis is critical to optimize clinical outcome, as mortality rates rise every hour treatment is delayed. Blood culture remains the ""gold standard"" for diagnosis but is limited by its long turnaround time (1-7 days depending on the organism) and its potential to provide false-negative results due to interference by antimicrobial therapy or the presence of mixed (i.e., polymicrobial) infections. In this paper, we evaluated the performance of resistance and pathogen ID/BSI, a direct-from-specimen molecular assay. To reduce the false-positivity rate common with molecular methods, this assay isolates and detects genomic material only from viable microorganisms in the blood by incorporating a novel precursor step to selectively lyse host and non-viable microbial cells and remove cell-free genomic material prior to lysis and analysis of microbial cells. Here, we demonstrate that the assay is free of interference from host immune cells and common antimicrobial agents at elevated concentrations.

25695147,Biomarker-guided personalised emergency medicine for all - hope for another hype?,"Polymorbid patients, diverse diagnostic and therapeutic options, more complex hospital structures, financial incentives, benchmarking, as well as perceptional and societal changes put pressure on medical doctors, specifically if medical errors surface. This is particularly true for the emergency department setting, where patients face delayed or erroneous initial diagnostic or therapeutic measures and costly hospital stays due to sub-optimal triage. A ""biomarker"" is any laboratory tool with the potential better to detect and characterise diseases, to simplify complex clinical algorithms and to improve clinical problem solving in routine care. They must be embedded in clinical algorithms to complement and not replace basic medical skills. Unselected ordering of laboratory tests and shortcomings in test performance and interpretation contribute to diagnostic errors. Test results may be ambiguous with false positive or false negative results and generate unnecessary harm and costs. Laboratory tests should only be ordered, if results have clinical consequences. In studies, we must move beyond the observational reporting and meta-analysing of diagnostic accuracies for biomarkers. Instead, specific cut-off ranges should be proposed and intervention studies conducted to prove outcome relevant impacts on patient care. The focus of this review is to exemplify the appropriate use of selected laboratory tests in the emergency setting for which randomised-controlled intervention studies have proven clinical benefit. Herein, we focus on initial patient triage and allocation of treatment opportunities in patients with cardiorespiratory diseases in the emergency department. The following five biomarkers will be discussed: proadrenomedullin for prognostic triage assessment and site-of-care decisions, cardiac troponin for acute myocardial infarction, natriuretic peptides for acute heart failure, D-dimers for venous thromboembolism, C-reactive protein as a marker of inflammation, and procalcitonin for antibiotic stewardship in infections of the respiratory tract and sepsis. For these markers we provide an overview on physiopathology, historical evolution of evidence, strengths and limitations for a rational implementation into clinical algorithms. We critically discuss results from key intervention trials that led to their use in clinical routine and potential future indications. The rational for the use of all these biomarkers, first, tackle diagnostic ambiguity and consecutive defensive medicine, second, delayed and sub-optimal therapeutic decisions, and third, prognostic uncertainty with misguided triage and site-of-care decisions all contributing to the waste of our limited health care resources. A multifaceted approach for a more targeted management of medical patients from emergency admission to discharge including biomarkers, will translate into better resource use, shorter length of hospital stay, reduced overall costs, improved patients satisfaction and outcomes in terms of mortality and re-hospitalisation.

This study aims to enhance early identification and diagnostic accuracy for laboratory physicians, while providing evidence to guide clinical diagnosis and treatment of Moraxella catarrhalis-related infections. This retrospective cohort study analyzed pediatric patients with Moraxella catarrhalis lower respiratory tract infections in southwestern Shandong Province, China. Clinical isolates were obtained through standardized sputum/bronchoalveolar lavage collection protocols and subjected to microbiological identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and molecular characterization of β-lactamase production and bro gene variants. Epidemiological patterns and clinical profiles were systematically evaluated using electronic medical record data spanning January 2020 to December 2023. During the 4-year surveillance period (2018-2021), Moraxella catarrhalis was isolated from 848 pediatric cases of lower respiratory tract infections, representing a 7.81% overall detection rate. Age-stratified analysis revealed the highest prevalence in infants aged 28 days to 1 year (9.69%), with significant seasonal variation peaking in the fourth quarter (11.58%, p < 0.05). Monomicrobial infections predominated (79.72%, 676/848), while polymicrobial cases (20.28%, 172/848) predominantly co-occurred with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. All isolates were confirmed through parallel testing using automated biochemical analyzers and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Antimicrobial susceptibility profiling demonstrated complete susceptibility to ceftazidime, cefepime, and imipenem (100%), with ≥ 95% susceptibility rates to ciprofloxacin (98.2%), levofloxacin (97.6%), ceftriaxone (96.8%), cefuroxime (96.1%), tetracycline (95.4%), and chloramphenicol (95.1%). A concerning temporal escalation in erythromycin resistance was observed (69.73% in 2018 vs. 90.57% in 2021, χ²=41.32, p < 0.001), while ampicillin and clindamycin resistance remained persistently high (> 93% across all years).β-lactamase production was detected in 96.58% (819/848) of isolates, with molecular characterization identifying bro-1 (94.51%, 774/819) and bro-2 (5.49%, 45/819) gene variants. The β-lactamase-negative subgroup (3.42%, 29/848) showed no significant epidemiological clustering. Our surveillance study demonstrates that Moraxella catarrhalis lower respiratory tract infections in southwestern Shandong Province predominantly affect infants aged 28 days to 1 year, with significantly elevated seasonal incidence during the fourth quarter. Notably, we observed a concerning temporal escalation in erythromycin resistance and persistently high resistance rates to ampicillinand clindamycin throughout the 2018-2021 surveillance period. Crucially, β-lactamase hyperproduction particularly BRO-1 gene carriage emerged as the principal resistance mechanism against β-lactams, while maintained susceptibility to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems suggests preserved therapeutic options.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the BioFire FilmArray Blood Culture Identification 2 (BCID2) panel for BSIs compared to conventional methods (CTMs) and its impact on antimicrobial treatment decisions. The study included 93 positive blood cultures from 85 patients with suspected BSI between January and August 2024. The BCID2 system demonstrated an accuracy of 90.32% in identifying positive samples in culture. The analytical sensitivity was calculated to be 83.72%, while the clinical sensitivity was determined to be 77.41% at the sample level. The highest concordance at the isolate level was observed for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Acinetobacter baumannii, with a 100% concordance rate. The compatibility of the method with conventional techniques was found in 85.13% of monomicrobial samples and 47.36% of polymicrobial samples. The mean time to result was determined as 1 day and 4 hours for BCID2 and 2 days and 4 hours for CTMs to identification; the difference was found to be significant. With regard to the detection of antimicrobial resistance genes, a 73.46% concordance was observed between BCID2 and conventional phenotypic methods at the sample level. While the presence of resistance was detected phenotypically in A. baumannii isolates, this could not be demonstrated genotypically with BCID2. In treatment simulations for antimicrobial stewardship, 91.5% of correct treatment arrangements were achieved according to the Norwegian guideline. Furthermore, an examination of the impact of gram stain pattern on diagnostic agreement revealed 90% agreement in anaerobic bottles, 77.77% in pediatric bottles, and 73.43% in aerobic bottles. However, these differences were not found to be statistically significant. Conversely, a significant difference in agreement rates was observed according to gram stain pattern, with 94.1% agreement observed in gram-positive cocci and 79.1% in gram-negative bacilli, yielding a statistically significant difference.

40604030,Monolaurin inhibits antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in patients with atopic dermatitis.,"Frequent use of antibiotics increases the incidence of antimicrobial-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in atopic dermatitis (AD), which prompts the search for new treatments. Monolaurin is a chemical byproduct found in coconut oil and has anti-bacterial properties. This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of monolaurin on antimicrobial-resistant S. aureus. Thirty children and thirty adults diagnosed with AD were recruited and swabbed at three different sites: lesion, non-lesion, and nasal mucosa. Methicillin resistance and high-level mupirocin resistance in S. aureus were identified using mecA and mupA PCR, respectively, whilst fusidic acid resistance were detected by fusA gene sequencing. The broth microdilution method and tetrazolium bromide assays were used for monolaurin susceptibility and cellular cytotoxicity, respectively. We show that S. aureus was frequently isolated from lesions of both children and adults with AD. One isolate of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) harboring mecA, one isolate of mupirocin-resistant S. aureus harboring mupA, and four isolates of fusidic acid-resistant S. aureus with novel point mutations of fusA were found in the children group. In silico molecular docking showed that these mutants interacted weakly with fusidic acid, explaining the mechanism of drug resistance. Monolaurin inhibited these antimicrobial-resistant S. aureus isolates with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 2 µg/mL without cytotoxicity to cultured epidermal and dermal cells.

Data were retrieved from the prospective Cologne Cohort of Neutropenic Patients. Patients hospitalized for aSCT as well as patients receiving treatment for AML were included in the analysis. Risk factor analysis for the occurrence of CDI was performed by backward-stepwise logistic regression (P < .1). During the period from January 2007 to August 2010, 310 hospitalizations of 152 patients with AML and 229 hospitalizations of 223 patients undergoing aSCT were eligible for analysis. Incidence rates for CDI per 10,000 patient days were 17.9 for AML patients and 27.4 for aSCT recipients. Among AML and aSCT patients, median time from initiation of chemotherapy to CDI was 10 days (range, -8 to 101 days) and 17 days (range, 6 to 79), respectively. Logistic regression identified carbapenem exposure to be associated with development of CDI in AML patients (odds ratio [OR], 2.2) and aSCT recipients (OR, 1.4). In both groups, previous exposure to carbapenems was significantly associated with development of CDI.

C-reactive protein variations overtime appears to have a good performance for the diagnosis of infection. Procalcitonin shows a better correlation with clinical severity. In addition, to overcome the worldwide problem of antibiotic overuse as well as misuse, biomarker guidance of antibiotic stewardship represents a promising new approach. In several randomized, controlled trials, including adult critically ill patients, PCT guidance was repeatedly associated with a decrease in the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, these trials present several limitations, namely high rate of patients' exclusion, high rate of algorithm overruling, long duration of antibiotic therapy in the control group, disregard the effect of renal failure on PCT level, and above all a possible higher mortality and higher late organ failure in the PCT arm. In addition, some infections (e.g., endocarditis) as well as frequent nosocomial bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa) are not suitable to be assessed by PCT algorithms. Therefore, the true value of PCT-guided algorithm of antibiotic stewardship in assisting the clinical decision-making process at the bedside remains uncertain.

26617195,Mortality Benefits of Antibiotic Computerised Decision Support System: Modifying Effects of Age.,"Antibiotic computerised decision support systems (CDSSs) are shown to improve antibiotic prescribing, but evidence of beneficial patient outcomes is limited. We conducted a prospective cohort study in a 1500-bed tertiary-care hospital in Singapore, to evaluate the effectiveness of the hospital's antibiotic CDSS on patients' clinical outcomes, and the modification of these effects by patient factors. To account for clustering, we used multilevel logistic regression models. One-quarter of 1886 eligible inpatients received CDSS-recommended antibiotics. Receipt of antibiotics according to CDSS's recommendations seemed to halve mortality risk of patients (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.26-1.10, P = 0.09). Patients aged ≤65 years had greater mortality benefit (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.20-1.00, P = 0.05) than patients that were older than 65 (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.91-1.82, P = 0.16).

We aimed to evaluate physicians' perceptions and attitudes toward antibiotic CDSSs and determine psychosocial factors associated with acceptance of CDSS recommendations for empirical therapy. A mixed methods study was conducted in an adult tertiary-care hospital in Singapore, with its in-house antibiotic CDSS that integrates antimicrobial stewardship with electronic prescribing. Focus group discussions were conducted among purposively sampled physicians and data were analysed using the framework approach. Emerging themes were included in the questionnaire with newly developed scales for the subsequent cross-sectional survey involving all physicians. Principal components analysis was performed to derive the latent factor structure that was later applied in multivariate analyses. Physicians expressed confidence in the credibility of CDSS recommendations. Junior physicians accepted CDSS recommendations most of the time, whilst senior physicians acknowledged overriding recommendations in complex patients with multiple infections or allergies. Willingness to consult the CDSS for common and complex infections (OR=1.68, 95% CI 1.16-2.44) and preference for personal or team decision (OR=0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.85) were associated with acceptance of CDSS recommendations. Cronbach's α for scales measuring physicians' attitudes and perceptions towards acceptance of CDSS recommendations ranged from 0.64 to 0.88.

One way to reduce such delays may be through modifications to electronic prescribing (EP) systems. The research team evaluated the role of one such EP system in reducing delays in antibiotic administration in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). First, the delays in antibiotic administration in adult ICU patients was quantified. The EP system was then modified to remove deafult time settings for antibiotic doses, which ensured that all antibiotic doses were scheduled for administration within an hour of the prescription being generated. Enhanced training for clinicians and nurses was also implemented, focusing on the EP system and highlighting the importance of prompt antimicrobial prescribing and delivery to the patient. The antibiotic administration was re-audited, and a significant reduction in delays (p=0.002, Mann-Whitney U test) was found. This study demonstrates how prudent use of EP systems can help to reduce delays in antibiotic administration in an ICU setting, thus potentially contributing to reducing mortality in patients with sepsis.",BMJ quality improvement reports,2014,Philippa C Matthews; Tri Wangrangsimakul; Mark Borthwick; Clare Williams; Ivor Byren; Douglas Wilkinson,[],[],3

40426534,Antibiotic De-Escalation in the Intensive Care Unit: Rationale and Potential Strategies.,"Antibiotic de-escalation (ADE) is important to help optimize antibiotic use and balance the positive and negative effects of antimicrobial therapy. ADE should be performed promptly, and infections should be treated with the shortest course of antimicrobials as clinically feasible to avoid unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Several tools have been developed to increase efficient ADE, including rapid diagnostic tests (ex. multiplex PCR), MRSA nasal PCR/culture, and biomarkers. Multiplex PCR and MRSA nasal PCR/culture have been associated with reductions in inappropriate antibiotic use. Procalcitonin, a biomarker, has been associated with shorter antimicrobial durations in some studies; however, widespread use may be limited by lack of specificity for bacterial infections, cost, and lack of set cut-off points. Additional biomarkers such as IL-6, HMGB1, presepsin, sTREM-1, CD64, PSP, proadrenomedullin, and pentraxin-3 are currently being studied. As technology improves, additional tools may be leveraged to better optimize ADE even better, such as antimicrobial spectrum scoring tools and artificial intelligence (AI). Spectrum scores, which quantify antibiotic activity using specific numeric values, could be incorporated into electronic health records to identify patients on unnecessarily broad antibiotics. AI modeling has the potential to predict personal antibiograms or provide the probability that an empiric regimen may cover a particular infection, among other potential applications. This review will discuss the literature associated with ADE in the ICU, selected tools to help guide ADE, and perspectives on how to implement ADE into clinical practice.","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2025,Sarah Singer Matuszak; Lauren Kolodziej; Scott Micek; Marin Kollef,[],"['antibiotics', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'antimicrobial stewardship', 'de-escalation', 'duration', 'intensive care unit', 'rapid diagnostics', 'sepsis', 'spectrum']",3

32572350,Pharmacists and COVID-19.,"In the fight against COVID-19, frontline health workers have been vital to keeping the pandemic at bay, but recognition of individual professions' efforts have been inconsistent at all levels. Pharmacists around the world have continued to provide direct patient care and perform frontline duties for their communities during this pandemic, but are often relegated to the background and overlooked when frontline workers are heralded. Community pharmacists are the most accessible healthcare practitioners, which is further proven during the pandemic as they continued to provide direct patient care despite restrictions imposed by the government due to the pandemic. Due to the inaccessibility of other healthcare practitioners during this time, community pharmacists have reduced the burden on the healthcare system by diverting the influx of patients away from hospitals through triaging and screening patients. Community pharmacists have played various roles in supporting the healthcare system during COVID-19: delivering medications to patients, educating patients on telehealth services, assessing patients for renewal of chronic medications, performing consultations on minor ailments, clarifying misconceptions about COVID-19 treatments, and contributing to COVID-19 screening. Alongside ICU nurses, physicians, and respiratory therapists, hospital pharmacists have been part of the COVID-19 efforts and their roles include management of drug shortages, development of treatment protocols, participation of patient rounds, interpretation of lab results for COVID-19, participant recruitment for clinical trials, exploration of new drugs, medication management advice, and antimicrobial stewardship. Further support from pharmacists will be needed once a vaccine is launched in order to reach population-wide coverage. Amid COVID-19, pharmacists have not stopped working as frontline workers and they should be recognized as such.",Journal of pharmaceutical policy and practice,2020,Ali Elbeddini; Thulasika Prabaharan; Sarah Almasalkhi; Cindy Tran,[],"['COVID-19', 'Frontline health workers', 'Pandemic', 'Pharmacist']",2

Inappropriate antibiotic use is undesirable both on patient level, considering their exposure to side effects and drug interactions, and on societal level, given the development of antibiotic resistance. C-reactive protein (CRP) point-of-care testing (POCT) may be a promising diagnostic tool to reduce antibiotic prescribing for LRTI in nursing homes.

40603200,Advances in the critical care management for patients with hematological malignancies.,"Hematological malignancies (HMs) are increasingly associated with life-threatening complications requiring intensive care unit (ICU) management. Recent advancements in therapies, diagnostics, and critical care protocols have improved outcomes for these patients, yet significant challenges persist. This manuscript explores the evolving landscape of critical care in hematology, emphasizing the unique complications, management strategies, and future directions in the field. Patients with HMs are particularly vulnerable to infections, sepsis, organ dysfunction, and treatment-related toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), and coagulopathies. Innovations in the management of acute respiratory failure, septic shock, and invasive fungal infections have contributed to better survival rates, yet outcomes remain suboptimal for certain high-risk groups. Furthermore, new therapies, including CAR-T cells, bispecific antibodies, and immune checkpoint inhibitors, present both opportunities and challenges in the ICU setting due to their potential toxicities. Emerging trends emphasize the importance of early ICU admission, multidisciplinary collaboration, and precision medicine in improving patient care. The integration of biomarker-driven strategies, advanced diagnostics, and artificial intelligence holds promise for optimizing therapeutic interventions and enhancing antimicrobial stewardship. Additionally, patient-centered approaches, including time-limited trials and goal-oriented discussions, aim to balance aggressive care with quality-of-life considerations. This review underscores the need for continued research to address disparities in access to care, improve long-term outcomes, and develop standardized protocols for managing critically ill hematology patients.

40607535,Acute infectious gastroenteritis in childhood: the role of rapid multiplex molecular syndromic panels in diagnosis and clinical management.,"Acute infectious diarrhea is a major global health issue, especially in children, as gastrointestinal infections are the second most common infectious disease after respiratory infections. The implementation of rapid multiplex molecular syndromic panels (RMMSP) for the comprehensive detection and identification of enteric pathogens in stool samples has enhanced diagnostic precision, supplementing-or, in some cases, replacing-traditional methodologies. This narrative, non-systematic review synthesized the available evidence on the clinical performance of gastrointestinal RMMSP up to December 31, 2024. On May 27, 2024, specialists in Pediatrics and Microbiology met to assess the use of RMMSP in pediatric gastrointestinal infection diagnosis. This review focused on RMMSP applicable to urgent management of infectious acute gastroenteritis (AGE), excluding those panels unsuitable for immediate diagnosis. RMMSP facilitated rapid pathogen detection in pediatric infectious AGE and have shown potential advantages over traditional microbiological methods, including a reduction in time to appropriate treatment. Their use appeared particularly useful in emergency and inpatient settings for inflammatory AGE, prolonged traveler's diarrhea, or cases at risk for complications. They were also considered for outpatient diagnosis in moderate/severe cases, chronic diarrhea, or immunocompromised patients. Within a diagnostic stewardship framework, current evidence suggests that RMMSP can contribute to minimizing unnecessary testing and hospitalizations, improving outbreak control, and optimizing antimicrobial use. However, further research is necessary to refine diagnostic workflows and ensure timely result delivery. This document evaluated key aspects regarding the application of RMMSP in pediatric infectious AGE, aiming to establish standardized protocols, support clinical decision-making, and facilitate optimal patient management.",Revista espanola de quimioterapia : publicacion oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Quimioterapia,2025,Ana Belén Jiménez-Jiménez; Fátima Galán-Sánchez; Milagros García-López Hortelano; Victoria Fumadó; Llanos Salar-Vidal; José Tomás Ramos-Amador; Ana Isabel Menasalvas-Ruiz,"['Humans', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Child', 'Acute Disease', 'Diarrhea', 'Feces', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Child, Preschool']","['Acute gastroenteritis', 'Culture-independent diagnostic test', 'Diarrhea', 'Gastrointestinal infection', 'Multiplex PCR panel', 'Rapid multiplex molecular syndromic panels']",2

Data on the effectiveness of non-intravenous carbapenem-sparing antibiotic options are limited. This study compared the 30-day mortality and clinical failure associated with the use of carbapenems versus alternative non-intravenous antibiotics for the definitive treatment of ESBL/AmpC-positive Enterobacteriaceae bacteraemia. This 12-year retrospective study (2004-2015) included all patients with bacteraemia due to ESBL/AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae at a Spanish hospital. Given the lack of randomisation of initial therapies, a propensity score for receiving carbapenems was calculated. There were 1115 patients with a first episode of bacteraemia due to Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae, of which 123 (11.0%) were ESBL/AmpC-positive. There were 101 eligible patients: 59 in the carbapenem group and 42 in the alternative treatment group (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 59.5%, quinolones 21.4%). The most frequent sources of infection were urinary (63%) and biliary (15%). Compared with the carbapenem group, patients treated with an alternative regimen had a shorter hospital stay [median (IQR) 7 (5-10) days vs. 12 (9-18) days; P < 0.001]. Use of an alternative non-intravenous therapy did not increase mortality (OR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.05-1.61; P = 0.15). After controlling for confounding factors with the propensity score, the adjusted OR of carbapenem treatment was 4.95 (95% CI 0.94-26.01; P = 0.059). Alternative non-intravenous carbapenem-sparing antibiotics could have a role in the definitive treatment of ESBL/AmpC-positive Enterobacteriaceae bacteraemia, allowing a reduction in carbapenem use.

It is important to understand the aetiopathogenesis of disease, population predispositions and the principles underlying diagnostic testing, including its benefits and limitations, to appropriately manage these cases in clinical practice. Diagnostic testing and treatment should be carried out in a targeted manner only where indicated to do so.Evidence baseThis review provides extensive summaries of the most pertinent feline enteropathogens and diagnostic methods available, as well as their limitations, with a particular focus on molecular testing. The authors have provided their substantiated opinion on how best to approach these cases.Global importanceAn enhanced understanding of feline enteric disease is required not only for improved management of these veterinary patients but also particularly relates to the critical topic of antibiotic stewardship and judicious use of antibiotics, which form the mainstay of treatment for many enteropathogens, but are often used inappropriately in healthy cats testing positive for organisms that are not implicated in enteric disease.AudienceThe target audience for this review encompasses general and specialist practitioners, alongside researchers within this field.",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,2025,Giulia Cattaneo; Katie E McCallum,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Cat Diseases', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents']","['Enteropathogens', 'PCR', 'intestinal disease', 'molecular diagnostics', 'molecular testing']",2
39382853,Microbiota restoration for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection.,"Since the publication of the recent North American and European guidelines on management of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), new evidence describing the epidemiology, testing and treatment of CDI has emerged. Despite all advances in infection control and antibiotic stewardship, the incidence and burden of CDI in the hospitals and the community remains at a stable high. Coupled with the incidence of primary CDI, there is a stable high incidence of recurrent CDI. Testing for primary and recurrent CDI remains a clinical challenge owing to high sensitivity of the PCR (leading to false positives) and somewhat limited sensitivity of EIA for toxin. The pathophysiology of recurrent CDI involves an ongoing disruption of the microbiota owing to the infection and the treatment of CDI employed. Broad spectrum antibiotics such as vancomycin leads to further disruption of microbiota compared to fidaxomicin which has a lower disruption of the microbiota and leads to fewer recurrences. Owing to these data fidaxomicin is considered as the first line antibiotic for recurrent CDI. Intravenous bezlotoxumab is a monoclonal antibody that reduces the risk of recurrence in high-risk patients but does not restore the microbiota. Experimental fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been available for more than a decade. Owing to the success of FMT, two new non-invasive donor dependent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved therapies have been available since late 2022. This review summarizes all these conundrums regarding CDI and provides clinical pearls to use in day-to-day practice.",Panminerva medica,2024,Sahil Khanna,"['Humans', 'Clostridium Infections', 'Fecal Microbiota Transplantation', 'Clostridioides difficile', 'Recurrence', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Fidaxomicin', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal']",[],2

The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of PCT to shorten antibiotic treatment in critically-ill patients with bloodstream infections. Furthermore, the mortality and ICU length of stay (LOS) in such patients were secondary outcomes. Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and Cochrane Databases were searched from January 1, 2007 to September 1, 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on using PCT to guide antibiotic therapy compared with routine treatments for administration of antibiotics in critically-ill adult patients published in English were included. Two reviewers assessed the methodology of the studies included and extracted their data using the CONSORT checklist. Inverse-variance weighting and fixed and random effects meta-analyses were performed using the length of antibiotic treatment, LOS in an intensive care unit (ICU) and all-cause mortality. No significant reduction was found in the length of antibiotic treatment: although the cut-off point of 0.25<PCT<0.5ng/mL resulted in the reduced length of antibiotic treatment, this effect was not significant. Moreover, there was no significant reduction in ICU LOS and mortality. The analysis showed the effectiveness of the PCT cut-off level of 0.25<PCT<0.5ng/mL in decreasing the length of antibiotic treatment and ICU LOS, although this effect was not significant.

31970713,Omadacycline: A Novel Oral and Intravenous Aminomethylcycline Antibiotic Agent.,"Omadacycline is a novel aminomethylcycline antibiotic developed as a once-daily, intravenous and oral treatment for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Omadacycline, a derivative of minocycline, has a chemical structure similar to tigecycline with an alkylaminomethyl group replacing the glycylamido group at the C-9 position of the D-ring of the tetracycline core. Similar to other tetracyclines, omadacycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Omadacycline possesses broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic, anaerobic, and atypical bacteria. Omadacycline remains active against bacterial isolates possessing common tetracycline resistance mechanisms such as efflux pumps (e.g., TetK) and ribosomal protection proteins (e.g., TetM) as well as in the presence of resistance mechanisms to other antibiotic classes. The pharmacokinetics of omadacycline are best described by a linear, three-compartment model following a zero-order intravenous infusion or first-order oral administration with transit compartments to account for delayed absorption.

39272715,Assessing Diagnostic Performance of Molecular Culture for Neonatal Sepsis: Protocol of the CHAMPIONS Study.,"Managing neonatal sepsis is challenging due to nonspecific clinical signs, hematological markers with poor accuracy, and a lengthy turnaround time for the identification of microorganisms. Delaying the initiation of antibiotics in truly infected infants can lead to severe morbidity and mortality. Therefore, decisions regarding empiric antibiotic treatment are risk stratified, which exposes many uninfected infants to antibiotics. This causes gut microbiota perturbation, unnecessary hospital admissions, and the generation of multi-resistant organisms. High-speed diagnostic assays could expedite discontinuation or avert the initiation of antibiotics in uninfected infants. This study will evaluate the diagnostic performance of molecular culture (MC), a rapid broad-range PCR-based bacterial profiling technique, for diagnosing neonatal sepsis in infants below 90 days old. A multi-center prospective observational cohort study will include infants evaluated for early and late-onset sepsis. Routine evaluation for suspected sepsis includes microbiological cultures of blood. Additionally, blood for MC will be collected. For early-onset sepsis, umbilical cord blood may be used alternatively. Primary outcome is the agreement between MC and conventional blood culture results. Secondary outcome is the agreement of both assays with clinical sepsis using four different, commonly used definitions. Faster diagnostic pathways for sepsis may reduce antibiotic exposure time. Broad-range molecular assays may identify pathogens undetectable by conventional methods. Employment of umbilical cord blood samples for early-onset sepsis diagnosis can resolve challenges in collecting adequate blood volume and could further expedite treatment decisions.","Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,Jip Groen; Martijn van der Kuip; Dries Budding; Martine P Bos; Marc A Benninga; Hendrik J Niemarkt; Tim G J de Meij,[],"['PCR', 'antibiotic', 'bacteria', 'culture', 'diagnostic', 'molecular', 'neonatal', 'sepsis', 'stewardship']",2

Therefore, it is an urgent need to optimize and evaluate infection prevention and control (IPC) strategies. Several infection outbreaks in German neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) required rapid responses by hospitals and improved future preparedness. As a consequence, German authorities recommended weekly colonization screening on NICUs. This screening aims to detect multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) and bacteria with high transmissibility. According to these guidelines, infants colonized with multiresistant gram-negative (MRGN) bacteria with in-vitro resistance to piperacillin and cephalosporins (2MRGN) should be cared wearing non-sterile gloves and gowns in addition to standard hygiene precautions. Whether these extended IPC measures have an individual benefit for infants or contribute to the prevention of infection outbreaks has not yet been scientifically proven. This study aims to evaluate the effect of hand desinfection as compared to hand desinfection + gloves and gowns (barrier care) for the care of 2MRGN colonized infants in NICUs on infection and transmission rates through a multicenter, cluster randomized controlled trial (BALTIC study, Barrier protection to lower transmission and infection rates with Gram-negative 2-MRGN in preterm children).",Molecular and cellular pediatrics,2025,Kirstin Faust; Clara Haug; Julia Pagel; Reinhard Jensen; Anja Stein; Ursula Felderhoff-Müser; David Frommhold; Kirsten Brebach; Christian Wieg; Georg Hillebrand; Barbara Naust; Esther Schmidt; Lutz Koch; Susanne Schmidtke; Arne Simon; Michael Zemlin; Sascha Meyer; Christopher Scholzen; Natascha Köstlin-Gille; Christian Gille; Ann-Carolin Longardt; Manuela Kärlin; Mirjam Lusga; Wolfgang Göpel; Manuel Krone; Stefanie Kampmeier; Franziska Strecker; Dennis Nurjadi; Inke R König; Egbert Herting; Jan Rupp; Christoph Härtel,[],"['Gown', 'Hand hygiene', 'Multi-drug-resistant organisms', 'Non-sterile glove use', 'Preterm infants', 'Sepsis']",2

35294769,Sulopenem: An Intravenous and Oral Penem for the Treatment of Urinary Tract Infections Due to Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria.,"Sulopenem (formerly known as CP-70,429, and CP-65,207 when a component of a racemic mixture with its R isomer) is an intravenous and oral penem that possesses in vitro activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant, extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL)-producing, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacterales. Sulopenem is being developed to treat patients with uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) as well as intra-abdominal infections. This review will focus mainly on its use in UTIs. The chemical structure of sulopenem shares properties of penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. Sulopenem is available as an oral prodrug formulation, sulopenem etzadroxil, which is hydrolyzed by intestinal esterases, resulting in active sulopenem. In early studies, the S isomer of CP-65,207, later developed as sulopenem, demonstrated greater absorption, higher drug concentrations in the urine, and increased stability against the renal enzyme dehydropeptidase-1 compared with the R isomer, which set the stage for its further development as a UTI antimicrobial. Sulopenem is active against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms. Sulopenem's β-lactam ring alkylates the serine residues of penicillin-binding protein (PBP), which inhibits peptidoglycan cross-linking. Due to its ionization and low molecular weight, sulopenem passes through outer membrane proteins to reach PBPs of Gram-negative bacteria. While sulopenem activity is unaffected by many β-lactamases, resistance arises from alterations in PBPs (e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]), expression of carbapenemases (e.g., carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales and in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia), reduction in the expression of outer membrane proteins (e.g., some Klebsiella spp.), and the presence of efflux pumps (e.g., MexAB-OprM in Pseudomonas aeruginosa), or a combination of these mechanisms. In vitro studies have reported that sulopenem demonstrates greater activity than meropenem and ertapenem against Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), and Staphylococcus epidermidis, as well as similar activity to carbapenems against Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. With some exceptions, sulopenem activity against Gram-negative aerobes was less than ertapenem and meropenem but greater than imipenem. Sulopenem activity against Escherichia coli carrying ESBL, CTX-M, or Amp-C enzymes, or demonstrating MDR phenotypes, as well as against ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, was nearly identical to ertapenem and meropenem and greater than imipenem. Sulopenem exhibited identical or slightly greater activity than imipenem against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis. The pharmacokinetics of intravenous sulopenem appear similar to carbapenems such as imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, and doripenem.

8738202,A prospective audit of wound infection rates after caesarean section in five West Yorkshire hospitals.,"A three month prospective audit of wound infection following emergency and elective caesarean section was carried out in five West Yorkshire hospitals. Among 4076 women undergoing delivery in the five obstetric departments, the caesarean rate was 15.4%. The overall infection rate was 45/628 (7.2%) with a range of 2.5-17.2% between the five centres. The infection rate was 14/226 (6.2%) when antibiotics were used compared with 31/402 (7.7%) without antibiotics. The use of prophylactic antibiotics made no significant difference to the infection rate, which did not correlate with duration of labour or of ruptured membranes. The number of vaginal examinations correlated with the infection rate. In conclusion, the caesarean section rate observed was higher than that estimated for the UK as a whole, but was distorted by one centre with a high rate. For the other four hospitals the caesarean rate was unexceptional. The ratio of emergency to elective operations was comparable with recently reported values in the UK and the wound infection rate was within the widely varying limits found in previous studies. In view of the relatively low infection rate recorded without antibiotics, in the interests of cost effectiveness, prophylaxis may be limited in future to selected women at high risk.

The post-operative recovery was assessed by completion of a parent questionnaire which included the following parameters: degree of patient distress, nausea and vomiting, otalgia, halitosis, pharyngeal bleeding, analgesic requirement, day of return to a regular diet and General Practitioner consultation. There was no significant reduction in any of the morbidity measures in patients treated with antibiotics. I fact, the analgesic requirement and the incidence of otalgia and irritability on Days 6 and 7 and secondary haemorrhage were significantly higher in the antibiotic-treated patients. Although the number of patients included in this study are small, the result suggest that post-operative antibiotics do not improve the outcome of uncomplicated tonsillectomy.

The accuracy of the determination of high-risk factors has been assessed as has the correlation between bile colonization and patients assessed as 'high risk'. Organisms were cultured from the bile of 121 (19 per cent) patients and among these the incidence of wound or intra-abdominal sepsis was 22 per cent whereas among patients with sterile bile the incidence was only 2 per cent (P less than 0.0001). Although the incidence of bile colonization within the high-risk group (32 per cent) was more than twice that in the low-risk group (14 per cent), more than half (54 per cent) of the patients with positive bile cultures were in the low-risk group.

This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of educational interventions for health workers on antibiotic prescribing rates in Chinese outpatient settings. Eight databases were searched for relevant randomized clinical trials, non-randomized trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time-series studies from January 2001 to July 2021. A total of 16 studies were included in the systematic review and 12 in the meta-analysis. The results showed that educational interventions overall reduced the antibiotic prescription rate significantly (relative risk, RR 0.72, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.61 to 0.84). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that certain features of education interventions had a significant effect on antibiotic prescription rate reduction: (1) combined with compulsory administrative regulations (RR With: 0.65 vs. Without: 0.78); (2) combined with financial incentives (RR With: 0.51 vs. Without: 0.77). Educational interventions can also significantly reduce antibiotic injection rates (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.94) and the inappropriate use of antibiotics (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.73). The limited number of high-quality studies limits the validity and reliability of the results.

37739225,Short-Course Empiric Antibiotics in Children Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.,"Fever is common in children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Empiric antibiotic (EA) therapy is initiated and often continued until neutrophil engraftment. Prolonged antibiotic exposure reduces microbiome diversity and causes overgrowth of pathogenic organisms, leading to such complications as infections from antibiotic-resistant organisms and Clostridium difficile colitis. Shorter courses of EA therapy have been studied in adults undergoing HCT without significant safety concerns, but data in children are lacking. We instituted a single-center preintervention/ postintervention quality improvement (QI) project to assess the feasibility of short-course EA therapy for first fever in patients undergoing HCT. We aimed to reduce the median duration of broad-spectrum antibiotic use in eligible patients from 20 days in 2020 to 10 days in 2021. Patients were eligible for the intervention, limiting EAs to 7 days for first fever, if they were admitted for their first allogeneic HCT, were afebrile for >24 hours, had no infection requiring systemic treatment, and were hemodynamically stable. Outcome measures included days of EA therapy for first fever and total broad-spectrum antibiotic use during the period of hospitalization, defined as the time from the start of conditioning to 30 days after HCT or hospital discharge, whichever occurred first. Balancing measures included bloodstream infection (BSI), fever, and intensive care (ICU) admission within 3 days of stopping EA therapy. Project criteria were applied retrospectively to patients who underwent HCT in 2020 to construct a preintervention short-course-eligible cohort. During the intervention period, 41 patients underwent allogeneic HCT, of whom 17 (41%) were eligible for short-course EA therapy. Among eligible patients, the median age was 5.3 years, 47% had an underlying malignancy, and 88% received myeloablative conditioning. There were no differences in demographic or HCT characteristics between patients eligible for short-course EA during the intervention and preintervention period (n = 24). The short-course EA schedule was adhered to by 14 of the 17 eligible patients (82%). The duration of EA for first fever and total broad-spectrum antibiotic use was significantly decreased in the short-course EA-eligible patients compared to the preintervention cohort, from a median of 17 days to 8 days and from 20 days to 10 days, respectively (P < .01). Of the 14 patients adhering to short-course EA, 2 experienced a balancing measure of recurrent fever requiring resumption of EA, but no infection was identified. There were no BSIs, ICU admissions, or deaths during the hospitalization period in patients who received short-course EA. In this single-center QI project, short-course EA for initial fever was successfully applied to children undergoing allogeneic HCT using strict criteria and led to a significant decrease in broad-spectrum antibiotic use during hospitalization. These results should be validated in a prospective clinical trial to include the impact of short-course EA on antibiotic-resistant organisms, the intestinal microbiome, and HCT outcomes.",Transplantation and cellular therapy,2023,Pratik A Patel; Mehgan F Teherani; Yijin Xiang; Valeria Bernardo; Shanmuganathan Chandrakasan; Kathryn P Goggin; Ann Haight; Edwin Horwitz; Wayne H Liang; Suhag H Parikh; Michelle L Schoettler; Kathleen Spencer; Elizabeth Stenger; Benjamin Watkins; Kirsten M Williams; Kathryn Leung; Preeti Jaggi; Muna Qayed,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Fever', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Retrospective Studies']","['Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial stewardship', 'Fever neutropenia', 'Hematopoietic cell transplant', 'Pediatrics']",2

The onset of antimicrobial resistance and subsequent multi-drug resistant organisms (MDRO) significantly increase healthcare-associated expenditure with adverse clinical outcomes. The present study was undertaken to identify the trends of BSI in community settings in secondary care hospitals (smaller private hospitals and district hospitals) in the state of Madhya Pradesh in Central India with the support of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Health Mission, Madhya Pradesh. Methodology The present study was a prospective, longitudinal observational chart review type of study. The study was carried out at 10 secondary care hospitals (eight smaller private hospitals and two government district hospitals) nominated by the State Government as part of the ICMR Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance and Research Network (AMRSN). The hospitals were nominated depending on the availability of a microbiology laboratory and a full-time microbiologist. Result A total of 6202 blood samples were received from patients with suspected BSI, out of which 693 samples were positive for aerobic culture. Among these, 621 (89.6%) showed bacterial growth and 72 (10.3%) grew Candida species (spp). Out of the 621 bacterial growth samples, Gram-negative bacteria were 406 (65.3%) and Gram-positive bacteria were 215 (34.6%).

This translational research determined the cost-effectiveness of state-wide implementation of a whole of hospital Sepsis Pathway in reducing mortality and/or hospital admission costs from a healthcare sector perspective, and report the cost of implementation over 12-months. A non-randomised stepped wedge cluster implementation study design was used to implement an existing Sepsis Pathway (""Think sepsis. Act fast"") across 10 of Victoria's public health services, comprising 23 hospitals, which provide hospital care to 63% of the State's population, or 15% of the Australian population. The pathway utilised a nurse led model with early warning and severity criteria, and actions to be initiated within 60 minutes of sepsis recognition. Pathway elements included oxygen administration; blood cultures (x2); venous blood lactate; fluid resuscitation; intravenous antibiotics, and increased monitoring. At baseline there were 876 participants (392 female (44.7%), mean 68.4 years); and during the intervention, there were 1,476 participants (684 female (46.3%), mean 66.8 years). Mortality significantly reduced from 11.4% (100/876) at baseline to 5.8% (85/1,476) during implementation (p>0.001). Respectively, at baseline and intervention the average length of stay was 9.1 (SD 10.3) and 6.2 (SD 7.9) days, and cost was $AUD22,107 (SD $26,937) and $14,203 (SD $17,611) per patient, with a significant 2.9 day reduction in length of stay (-2.9; 95%CI -3.7 to -2.2, p<0.01) and $7,904 reduction in cost (-$7,904; 95%CI -$9,707 to -$6,100, p<0.01). The Sepsis Pathway was a dominant cost-effective intervention due to reduced cost and reduced mortality. Cost of implementation was $1,845,230. In conclusion, a well-resourced state-wide Sepsis Pathway implementation initiative can save lives and dramatically reduce the health service cost per admission.",PLOS global public health,2023,Natasha K Brusco; Kelly Sykes; Allen C Cheng; Camilla Radia-George; Douglas Travis; Natalie Sullivan; Tammy Dinh; Sarah Foster; Karin Thursky,[],[],2

Fluoroquinolones are an appropriate target for restriction based on their propensity for overuse and potential for causing ""collateral damage."" Aim Evaluate the impact of a multifaceted approach to decreasing fluoroquinolone use on consumption of fluoroquinolones and alternative antibiotics at a smaller, non-teaching facility. Method Prospective, interrupted time series analysis conducted at a single 288-bed, non-teaching hospital with 71 adult ICU beds comparing antibiotic consumption measured monthly by defined daily doses per 1000 adjusted patient days (DDD/1000 APD) prior to intervention (January 2011 to August 2014) to short-term (October 2014 to December 2015) and long-term (January 2018 to December 2019) periods following intervention. Results An increase in downward trends of fluoroquinolone use was observed from prior to intervention (-0.49 DDD/1000 APD) to the short-term period (-1.13 DDD/1000 APD) and to a greater extent in the long-term period following the intervention (-1.32 DDD/1000 APD). Fluoroquinolone consumption decreased from 100.20 DDD/1000 APD in August 2014 to 73.96 DDD/1000 APD in the short-term and 14.89 DDD/1000 APD in the long-term intervention period.

37214055,Antibiotic Use and Respiratory Viral PCR Testing Among Pediatric Patients With Nosocomial Fever.,"Objective Pediatric patients admitted to the hospital often develop fevers during their inpatient stay, and many children are empirically started on antibiotics. The utility of respiratory viral panel (RVP) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing in the evaluation of nosocomial fevers in admitted patients is unclear. We sought to evaluate whether RVP testing is associated with the use of antibiotics among inpatient pediatric patients. Patients and methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of children admitted from November 2015 to June 2018. We included all patients who developed fever 48 hours or more after admission to the hospital and who were not already receiving treatment for a presumed infection (on antibiotics). Results Among 671 patients, there were 833 inpatient febrile episodes. The mean age of children was 6.3 years old, and 57.1% were boys. Out of 99 RVP samples analyzed, 22 were positive (22.2%). Antibiotics were started in 27.8% while 33.5% of patients were already on antibiotics. On multivariate logistic regression, having an RVP sent was significantly associated with increased initiation of antibiotics (aOR 95% CI 1.18-14.18, p=0.03). Furthermore, those with a positive RVP had a shorter course of antibiotics compared to those with a negative RVP (mean 6.8 vs 11.3 days, p=0.019). Conclusions Children with positive RVP had decreased antibiotic exposure compared to those with negative RVP results. RVP testing may be used to promote antibiotic stewardship among hospitalized children.",Cureus,2023,Carlo Foppiano Palacios; Eric Lemmon; Katelyn E Donohue; Mark Sutherland; James Campbell,[],"['antibiotic administration', 'inpatient fever', 'pediatrics', 'viral infection', 'viral multiplex pcr']",2

39931585,Carbapenem Usage in the Initial Antibiotic Therapy of Sepsis in Japanese Intensive Care Units.,"Background Achieving a balance between the utilization and limitation of carbapenems for initial sepsis therapy is imperative, yet documentation on the use of carbapenems in sepsis treatment is limited. This study aimed to ascertain the prevalence of carbapenem use in Japanese intensive care units (ICUs) and evaluate the association between its use in the initial antibiotic therapy for sepsis and patient prognosis.  Methods This study is a post hoc descriptive analysis of the Focused Outcome Research on Emergency Care for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Sepsis, and Trauma (FORECAST), a multicenter, prospective cohort study conducted in 59 ICUs in Japan from January 2016 to March 2017. This study described the rate of carbapenem use overall and in each ICU and assessed the association between carbapenem use and in-hospital mortality by generalized linear mixed effect model adjusting for patient characteristics as fixed effect confounders and the hospitals as random effect confounders. Results Out of 1140 participants, 627(55.0%) received and 513 (45.0%) did not receive carbapenems following the diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock. Patient severity was similar in both groups in terms of Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA; 9 and 8) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II; 23 and 22) scores. Among 48 of the 59 ICUs that registered more than three patients in the FORECAST registry, the median carbapenem utilization rate stood at 55.2% (minimum: 20.0%, maximum: 100.0%, IQR: 43.6%-67.2%). Hospital mortality rates were 25.6% and 20.5% in carbapenem recipients and non-recipients, respectively. A correlation between initial carbapenem use and increased in-hospital mortality was discerned in the unadjusted model (difference of 5.2%), but this association was not evident in the adjusted model (difference of 1.2%; 95%CI: -4.3,6.6; p=0.66). Conclusions Initial antibiotic therapy with carbapenems was noted in over half of the sepsis patients in Japanese ICUs.

11783694,Control of nosocomial multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae using a temporary restrictive antibiotic agent policy.,"An observational study on the epidemiology of multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae was conducted in the neurology and neurosurgery wards of a university hospital to determine the impact of hospital hygiene measures and an additional temporary restrictive antibiotic agent policy on the sudden rise in incidence of these bacteria. The incidence and prevalence of patients with multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae were assessed, and patient isolates were typed phenotypically and by random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. All hospital hygiene measures implemented were recorded, and the influence of the restrictive policy on antibiotic use was analyzed. This policy consisted of a prior authorization requirement and the withdrawal of all antibiotics with a possible selective pressure on multiresistant strains (gentamicin, tobramycin, quinolones, cotrimoxazole, broad-spectrum penicillins, and cephalosporins). This ban left only carbapenems and amikacin for treatment. Typing showed that 17 of the 61 (28%) patients involved were infected or colonized with a single multiresistant strain of Klebsiella oxytoca, for which an environmental source was identified. The isolates recovered from the other patients comprised eight different species, and subsequent genotyping yielded a great variety of strains. The increased incidence could not be controlled with hospital hygiene measures alone. Only after implementation of the restrictive antibiotic policy did the epidemic strain vanish and the endemic incidence of multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae decrease to <50% of the level before intervention. In the years since, the incidence has remained at this low level, and the antibiotic costs have decreased to a level lower than before intervention.",European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,2001,M A Leverstein-van Hall; A C Fluit; H E Blok; A T Box; E D Peters; A J Weersink; J Verhoef,"['Cross Infection', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Enterobacteriaceae Infections', 'Gentamicins', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infection Control', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Netherlands', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",[],2

In Indonesia, a recent study in patients with acute fever revealed that the prevalence of Rickettsioses is 10%. Many cases of Rickettsioses were often misdiagnosed with dengue fever, enteric fever, or leptospirosis due to their overlapping clinical manifestation. The limitation of point of care testing in Indonesia hindered the adequacy of diagnosis confirmation. Appropriate empirical or definitive treatment with macrolide, mainly doxycycline, is preferable compared to other broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as cephalosporin or quinolones.

DESIGN Quasi-experimental study SETTING A 700-bed academic medical center PATIENTS Patients admitted to any adult ICU METHODS Aggregate data for all adult ICUs were obtained for population-level antimicrobial use (days of therapy [DOT]), urine cultures performed, and bacteriuria, all measured per 1,000 patient days before the intervention (January-December 2012) and after the intervention (January-December 2013). These data were compared using interrupted time series negative binomial regression. Randomly selected patient charts from the population of adult ICU patients with orders for urine culture in the presence of indwelling or recently removed urinary catheters were reviewed for demographic, clinical, and antimicrobial use characteristics, and pre- and post-intervention data were compared. RESULTS Statistically significant reductions were observed in aggregate monthly rates of urine cultures performed and bacteriuria detected but not in DOT. At the patient level, compared with the pre-intervention group (n=250), in the post-intervention group (n=250), fewer patients started a new antimicrobial therapy based on urine culture results (23% vs 41%, P=.002), but no difference in the mean total DOT was observed. CONCLUSION A change in urine-culture ordering practice was associated with a decrease in the percentage of patients starting a new antimicrobial therapy based on the index urine-culture order but not in total duration of antimicrobial use in adult ICUs. Other drivers of antimicrobial use in ICU patients need to be evaluated by antimicrobial stewardship teams.

Candidaemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis primarily affect patients who are immunocompromised or critically ill. In contrast, mucocutaneous forms of candidiasis, such as oral thrush and vulvovaginal candidiasis, can occur in otherwise healthy individuals. Although mucocutaneous candidiasis is generally not life-threatening, it can cause considerable discomfort, recurrent infections, and complications, particularly in patients with underlying conditions such as diabetes or in those taking immunosuppressive therapies. The rise of difficult-to-treat Candida infections is driven by new host factors and antifungal resistance. Pathogens, such as Candida auris (Candidozyma auris) and fluconazole-resistant Candida parapsilosis, pose serious global health risks. Recent taxonomic revisions have reclassified several Candida spp, potentially causing confusion in clinical practice. Current management guidelines are limited in scope, with poor coverage of emerging pathogens and new treatment options. In this Review, we provide updated recommendations for managing Candida infections, with detailed evidence summaries available in the appendix.",The Lancet.

29969320,Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy algorithms for different types of acute respiratory infections based on previous trials.,"Although evidence indicates that use of procalcitonin to guide antibiotic decisions for the treatment of acute respiratory infections (ARI) decreases antibiotic consumption and improves clinical outcomes, algorithms used within studies had differences in PCT cut-off points and frequency of testing. We therefore analyzed studies evaluating procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy and propose consensus algorithms for different respiratory infection types. Areas covered: We systematically searched randomized-controlled trials (search strategy updated on February 2018) on procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy of ARI in adults using a pre-specified Cochrane protocol and analyzed algorithms from 32 trials that included 10,285 patients treated in primary care settings, emergency departments (ED), and intensive care units (ICU). We derived consensus algorithms for use of procalcitonin by the type of ARI including community-acquired pneumonia, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma exacerbation, sepsis, and post-operative sepsis due to respiratory infection. Consensus algorithm recommendations differ with regard to timing of treatment (i.e. timing of initiation in low-risk patients or discontinuation in high-risk patients) and procalcitonin cut-off points for the recommendation/strong recommendation to discontinue antibiotics (≤ 0.25/≤ 0.1 µg/L in ED and inpatients, ≤ 0.5/≤ 0.25 µg/L in ICU patients, and reduction by ≥ 80% from peak levels in sepsis patients). Expert commentary: Our proposed algorithms may facilitate safe and efficient implementation of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic protocols in diverse healthcare settings. Still, the decision about initiation and cessation of antibiotic treatment remains a clinical decision based on the patient assessment and the severity of illness and use of procalcitonin should not delay empirical treatment in high risk situations.",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,2018,Philipp Schuetz; Rebekka Bolliger; Meret Merker; Mirjam Christ-Crain; Daiana Stolz; Michael Tamm; Charles E Luyt; Michel Wolff; Stefan Schroeder; Vandack Nobre; Konrad Reinhart; Angela Branche; Pierre Damas; Maarten Nijsten; Rodrigo O Deliberato; Alessia Verduri; Bianca Beghé; Bin Cao; Yahya Shehabi; Jens-Ulrik S Jensen; Albertus Beishuizen; Evelien de Jong; Matthias Briel; Tobias Welte; Beat Mueller,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Procalcitonin', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Respiratory Tract Infections']","['Procalcitonin', 'antibiotic stewardship', 'pneumonia', 'respiratory infection', 'systematic review']",2

29948362,Analyzing candidemia guideline adherence identifies opportunities for antifungal stewardship.,"Candidemia epidemiology varies significantly by region; thus, local data are essential for evidence-based decision-making in prophylaxis and treatment. Current management strategies are derived from large randomized controlled trials mostly executed in large high-volume tertiary care centers. Results may not be entirely transferable to smaller hospitals. This study investigates epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment standards in six hospitals in the Cologne metropolitan area (number of inhabitants approx. one million). We assessed adherence to the current guideline of the European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) using the EQUAL Candida Score of the European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM). Data were documented by trained medical students as part of an integrated research and teaching concept at the University of Cologne. Between January 2014 and June 2017, 77 patients had candidemia, corresponding to an incidence of 0.2 cases/1000 admissions. While 55 patients were enrolled, 22 patients were excluded due to incompletely retrievable health records. Fluconazole monotherapy was the preferred first-line treatment in cases with Candida albicans infection (21/29). A central vascular catheter was present in 40 patients and was removed in 17 (43%) during treatment. Overall mortality at 30 days was 44%. Patients reached a mean EQUAL Candida Score of 9.9 (range 8-14), which was well below the maximum score of 22 for perfect guideline adherence. In summary, management of candidemia differed from current European recommendations. It remains unclear to what extent enhanced adherence would improve patient outcome.

36016255,,"Longitudinal data regarding the serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of S. pneumoniae-causing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in developing countries are limited. Our aim was to monitor the antimicrobial susceptibility, serotype distribution, and serotype coverage rates of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) and emerging non-vaccine serotypes (NVT) between 2012 and 2016 in central Thailand. Pneumococcal isolates from sterile specimens of patients, collected within a long-standing collaborative hospital network in central Thailand between 2012 and 2016, were studied. The pneumococcal serotypes included in the 15-valent PCV were identified by the quellung reaction, while the non-PCV15 serotypes were identified by multiplex PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined by the microbroth dilution or disk diffusion method. Of the 276 pneumococcal isolates, 129 (46.7%) were from children aged ≤5 years. Only 9.0% of patients with available data received the PCV prior to the onset of the IPD. The most common vaccine serotypes were 6B (17.4%), 19A (13.0%), and 14 (11.2%), respectively. Non-PCV15 serotypes were detected in 27.9%; the most common serotypes were 15B/C (5.1%), 15A/F (4.0%), and 23A (3.6%), respectively. The serotype coverage rates of PCV10 in children aged ≤5 years was 55.8%, and 53.3% across all ages. PCV13 provided similar coverage rates to that of PCV15, 71.3% in children aged ≤5 years, and 72.1% across all ages. High susceptibilities to cefotaxime (94.6%), ofloxacin (98.2%), linezolid (99.6%), and vancomycin (100.0%) were observed, while the susceptibility to erythromycin (50.0%), TMP-SMZ (41.3%), and tetracycline (27.2%) were low. The susceptibilities to penicillin, meropenem, and clindamycin were 85.9%, 85.9%, and 84.8%, respectively. Serotype 19A was associated with a lower susceptibility than the non-19A isolates for penicillin (75.0% vs. 87.5%, p = 0.045), meropenem (52.8% vs. 90.8%, p < 0.001), erythromycin (33.3% vs. 53.8%, p = 0.022), and TMP-SMZ (16.7% vs. 45.0%, p = 0.001). Although the majority of the pneumococcal serotypes causing IPD in central Thailand were covered by the currently available PCVs, 25% of IPD were caused by NVT. Several emerging NVT identified were 15B/C, 15A/F, and 23A. The high rates of resistance to penicillin, meropenem, erythromycin, TMP-SMZ, and tetracycline observed is a major concern.

38396594,An Evaluation of the Impact of an OPEN Stewardship Generated Feedback Intervention on Antibiotic Prescribing among Primary Care Veterinarians in Canada and Israel.,"An interrupted time-series study design was implemented to evaluate the impact of antibiotic stewardship interventions on antibiotic prescribing among veterinarians. A total of 41 veterinarians were enrolled in Canada and Israel and their prescribing data between 2019 and 2021 were obtained. As an intervention, veterinarians periodically received three feedback reports comprising feedback on the participants' antibiotic prescribing and prescribing guidelines. A change in the level and trend of antibiotic prescribing after the administration of the intervention was compared using a multi-level generalized linear mixed-effect negative-binomial model. After the receipt of the first (incidence rate ratios [IRR] = 0.88; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.79, 0.98), and second (IRR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.97) feedback reports, there was a reduced prescribing rate of total antibiotic when other parameters were held constant. This decline was more pronounced among Israeli veterinarians compared to Canadian veterinarians. When other parameters were held constant, the prescribing of critical antibiotics by Canadian veterinarians decreased by a factor of 0.39 compared to that of Israeli veterinarians. Evidently, antibiotic stewardship interventions can improve antibiotic prescribing in a veterinary setting.

The prevalence of different resistant species varies significantly between centers. Thus, the knowledge of local epidemiology is mandatory for deciding the most appr-opriate management protocols. In the era of increasing antibiotic resistance, empirical therapy of febrile neutropenia should be individualized.

27025522,Evaluation of a Computerized Decision Support Intervention to Decrease Use of Anti-Pseudomonal Carbapenems in Penicillin Allergic Patients.,"Allergies to β-lactam antibiotics are commonly documented in hospitalized patients; however, true allergy is uncommon. Cross-reactivity rates for advanced generation cephalosporins and carbapenems are low; particularly for patients without a history of symptoms consistent with type 1 hypersensitivity. We observed that providers preferentially prescribed antipseudomonal carbapenems (APC) over advanced generation cephalosporins for patients with β-lactam allergy history, including those with low risk for antimicrobial-resistant infections. Information was inserted into the computerized decision support system (CDSS) to aid clinicians in assessing β-lactam cross-reactivity risk and selecting appropriate therapy. A retrospective evaluation was conducted in a small hospital to assess the impact of the CDSS changes in APC prescribing. Inpatients (n = 68) who received at least one APC dose during hospitalization over a 13 month pre-intervention period were compared to inpatients who received an APC during the 15 month post-intervention period (n = 59) for documented APC indications and β-lactam allergy history. APC initiations were measured and corrected per 1000 patient-days; interrupted time-series analysis was performed to assess changes in use before and after implementation. Aggregate monthly APC initiations decreased from 7.01 to 6.14 per 1000 patient-days after the implementation (p = 0.03). Post-intervention APC initiations for patients with low-risk β-lactam histories decreased from 92% to 83% (p = 0.17). No adverse events were observed in patients with low-risk β-lactam histories. The intervention was associated with a reduction in APC initiations.","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2016,Christina Caplinger; Garret Smith; Richard Remington; Karl Madaras-Kelly,[],"['antimicrobial stewardship', 'antipseudomonal', 'carbapenem', 'computerized decision support system', 'β-lactam allergy', 'β-lactam cross-reactivity']",2

We performed linear regressions to analyse 6-year trends (2017-2022) and estimated predicted consumption from 2020 to 2022 using the compound annual growth rate from 2017 to 2019. To assess the impact of COVID-19, we compared observed and predicted relative changes in antibacterial consumption between 2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2020 (early pandemic) and between 2019 and 2022 (late pandemic).RESULTSFrom 2019 to 2020, hospital antibacterial consumption (anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) J01) decreased by 12% in DID but increased by 5% and 7% in DDD/1,000 PD and DDD/1,000 admissions, respectively. From 2017 to 2022, systemic antibacterials consumption declined significantly only when expressed in DID. Although all systemic antibacterial subclasses were used less than predicted between 2020 and 2022 when expressed in DID, hospital-based metrics showed higher consumption, except for macrolides and amphenicols. Broad-spectrum antibacterial consumption decreased from 2017 to 2022 when expressed in DID but fluctuated with hospital metrics, peaking in 2020, and exceeded forecasts.CONCLUSIONCOVID-19 altered trends in hospital antibacterial consumption, with contrasting patterns depending on the metric used, underline the importance of hospital-specific surveillance to support targeted stewardship and preparedness efforts.",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,2025,Laura Bonacini; Julie Domen; Paul De Munter; Maya Hites; Diana Huis In't Veld; Antonelle Pardo; Johan Van Laethem; Dirk Vogelaers; Boudewijn Catry; Lucy Catteau,"['Humans', 'Belgium', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'COVID-19', 'Retrospective Studies', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Hospitals', 'Drug Utilization', 'Pandemics', 'Hospitalization', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship']","['COVID-19', 'antibiotics', 'hospitals', 'surveillance']",2
40907740,Diagnostic accuracy of a host response test in suspected community-Acquired pneumonia during the COVID-19 era.,"Community-acquired pneumonia [CAP] is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, often complicated by diagnostic uncertainty and antibiotic overuse. This study evaluated the MeMed BV® host-response test in adults with suspected CAP, using clinical management and molecular detection as reference standards. Among 744 patients presenting with suspected CAP at Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway (2019-2023), across three prospective studies, 453 were included in the present study. Patients were classified using: [1] clinical management [antibiotic timing/duration], and [2] molecular detection via BioFire® FilmArray Pneumonia Plus panel on lower respiratory tract samples. MeMed BV® testing was performed retrospectively on stored serum/plasma, categorising results as bacterial, viral, or equivocal. Healthy controls [n = 20] were also tested. Among 442 patients classified by clinical management, the MeMed BV® test demonstrated a positive percent agreement [PPA] of 90.0% (95% CI: 86.4-92.7) and a negative percent agreement [NPA] was 44.1% (95% CI: 34.4-54.2). In 370 patients classified by molecular testing, PPA was 88.2% (95% CI: 83.6-91.7) and NPA was 30.1% (95% CI: 20.8-41.4. Equivocal results occurred in 7.5%. The test agreed with clinical management in 96.1% of cases with no detected pathogen. None of the healthy controls had bacterial scores. CONCLUSION: MeMed BV® demonstrated high sensitivity in identifying bacterial infections but limited specificity in viral infections, notably SARS-CoV-2.

However, transference of plasmids from Gram-positive cocci to Gram-negative bacilli is not well characterized. In this report, we describe the transfer of a conjugative plasmid carrying qacA from MRSA to Escherichia coli C600. We performed a conjugation experiment using a chlorhexidine resistant MRSA isolate (ST-105/SCCmec type III) carrying the gene qacA and qacC as the donor and a chlorhexidine susceptible E. coli C600 isolate as the receptor. Transconjugants were selected using MacConkey agar plates containing chlorhexidine in concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 16 g.L-1. To genotypically confirm the transfer of the resistance gene, the transconjugants were screened by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and submitted to Sanger's sequencing. MRSA isolates successfully transferred the chlorhexidine resistance gene (qacA) to the recipient E. coli strain C600. The E. coli transconjugant exhibited an important reduction of chlorhexidine susceptibility, with MICs increasing from ≤ 0.25 to ≥ 16 g.L-1 after conjugation. The qacA gene was detected by PCR as well as in the Sanger's sequencing analysis of DNA from transconjugant plasmids. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the plasmid p_8N_qac(MN687830.1) carrying qacA and its transfer by conjugation from a MRSA to an E. coli.

The methods were the biochemical Rapid ESBL NP®, the immunological NG-Test CTX-M MULTI®, and the E-test technique based on ESBL E-test®. One hundred forty-two blood cultures (BCs) positive for K. pneumoniae or E. coli were included. ESBL and carbapenemase phenotype were detected in 26.1% (n = 37) and 16.9% (n = 24), respectively. The Rapid ESBL NP®, NG-Test CTX-M MULTI®, and direct ESBL E-test® positive and negative predictive values with 95% confidence intervals were 1 (0.87-1) and 0.97 (0.92-0.99), 1 (0.87-1) and 0.97 (0.92-0.99), and 1 (0.88-1) and 1 (0.96-1), respectively. The three phenotypic methods evaluated showed good performance in the detection of ESBL phenotype from K. pneumoniae- or E. coli-positive BCs.

25197643,Implementation of a computerized decision support system to improve the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy using local microbiologic data.,"A prospective quasi-experimental study was undertaken in 218 patients with suspicion of nosocomial infection hospitalized in a polyvalent ICU where a new electronic device (GERB) has been designed for antibiotic prescriptions. Two GERB-based applications were developed to provide local resistance maps (LRMs) and preliminary microbiological reports with therapeutic recommendation (PMRTRs). Both applications used the data in the Laboratory Information System of the Microbiology Department to report on the optimal empiric therapeutic option, based on the most likely susceptibility profile of the microorganisms potentially responsible for infection in patients and taking into account the local epidemiology of the hospital department/unit. LRMs were used for antibiotic prescription in 20.2% of the patients and PMRTRs in 78.2%, and active antibiotics against the finally identified bacteria were prescribed in 80.0% of the former group and 82.4% of the latter. When neither LMRs nor PMRTRs were considered for empiric treatment prescription, only around 40% of the antibiotics prescribed were active. Hence, the percentage appropriateness of the empiric antibiotic treatments was significantly higher when LRM or PMRTR guidelines were followed rather than other criteria. LRMs and PMRTRs applications are dynamic, highly accessible, and readily interpreted instruments that contribute to the appropriateness of empiric antibiotic treatments.",BioMed research international,2014,Manuel Rodriguez-Maresca; Antonio Sorlozano; Magnolia Grau; Rocio Rodriguez-Castaño; Andres Ruiz-Valverde; Jose Gutierrez-Fernandez,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacteria', 'Cross Infection', 'Decision Support Systems, Clinical', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Electronics, Medical', 'Female', 'Health Plan Implementation', 'Health Planning Guidelines', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Prescription Drugs']",[],2
33558964,Effects of a nudge-based antimicrobial stewardship program in a pediatric primary emergency medical center.,"Outpatient medical facilities tend to have high antimicrobial prescription rates and are therefore major targets for antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs). Pediatric primary emergency medical centers in Japan have difficulties in implementing conventional ASPs due to the low continuity of stewardship. Accordingly, there is a need to develop effective ASP models for these facilities. We conducted a single-center, quasi-experimental study to evaluate the effects of a nudge-based ASP in reducing unnecessary third-generation cephalosporin (3GC) prescriptions in a pediatric primary emergency care center (PEC). The implemented ASP utilizes monthly newsletters that report current antimicrobial use patterns and prescribing targets. We compared the monthly 3GC prescription numbers and proportions of unnecessary prescriptions before and after the ASP was implemented. The trends in 3GC prescriptions were examined using an interrupted time-series analysis. The numbers of patients before and after ASP implementation were 129,156 and 28,834, respectively. The number of unnecessary 3GC prescriptions decreased by 67.2% in the year after ASP implementation. The interrupted time-series analysis showed that the ASP was significantly associated with a reduction in 3GC prescriptions (regression coefficient - 0.58, P < 0.001).Conclusion: The nudge-based ASP was effective in reducing 3GC use in a Japanese PEC. This simple and inexpensive approach may have applications in other outpatient facilities. What is Known: • Outpatient medical facilities tend to have high antimicrobial prescription rates. Despite the development of several strategies for outpatient antimicrobial stewardship programs, these approaches have not sufficiently reduced antimicrobial use. What is New • Our nudge-based antimicrobial stewardship program using newsletters was shown to be a simple, inexpensive, and feasible method for reducing unnecessary antimicrobial use in a pediatric primary emergency care center. This may represent an effective antimicrobial stewardship strategy in Japanese outpatient facilities.",European journal of pediatrics,2021,Ayumi Shishido; Shogo Otake; Makoto Kimura; Shinya Tsuzuki; Akiko Fukuda; Akihito Ishida; Masashi Kasai; Yoshiki Kusama,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Child', 'Emergency Service, Hospital', 'Humans', 'Japan']","['Antimicrobial stewardship', 'Nudge', 'Pediatric primary emergency care', 'Third-generation cephalosporin']",2

Here, we report coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens in patients admitted to the coronavirus disease (COVID) care facilities of an Indian tertiary care hospital. From June 2020 through January 2021, we tested 191 patients with SARS-CoV-2 for 33 other respiratory pathogens using an fast track diagnostics respiratory pathogen 33 (FTD-33) assay. Additionally, information regarding other relevant respiratory pathogens was collected by reviewing their laboratory data. Overall, 13 pathogens were identified among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 46.6% (89/191) of patients had coinfection with one or more additional pathogens. Bacterial coinfections (41.4% [79/191]) were frequent, with Staphylococcus aureus being the most common, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae. Coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 and Pneumocystis jirovecii or Legionella pneumophila were also identified. The viral coinfection rate was 7.3%, with human adenovirus and human rhinovirus being the most common. Five patients in our cohort had positive cultures for Acinetobacter baumannii and K. pneumoniae, and two patients had active Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. In total, 47.1% (90/191) of patients with coinfections were identified. The higher proportion of patients with coinfections in our cohort supports the systemic use of antibiotics in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with rapid de-escalation based on respiratory PCR/culture results. The timely and simultaneous identification of coinfections can contribute to improved health of COVID-19 patients and enhanced antibiotic stewardship during the pandemic.

25671431,"Characterization of a novel plasmid, pMAH135, from Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis.","Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) causes mainly two types of disease. The first is disseminated disease in immunocompromised hosts, such as individuals infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The second is pulmonary disease in individuals without systemic immunosuppression, and the incidence of this type is increasing worldwide. M. avium subsp. hominissuis, a component of MAC, causes infection in pigs as well as in humans. Many aspects of the different modes of M. avium infection and its host specificity remain unclear. Here, we report the characteristics and complete sequence of a novel plasmid, designated pMAH135, derived from M. avium strain TH135 in an HIV-negative patient with pulmonary MAC disease. The pMAH135 plasmid consists of 194,711 nucleotides with an average G + C content of 66.5% and encodes 164 coding sequences (CDSs). This plasmid was unique in terms of its homology to other mycobacterial plasmids. Interestingly, it contains CDSs with sequence homology to mycobactin biosynthesis proteins and type VII secretion system-related proteins, which are involved in the pathogenicity of mycobacteria. It also contains putative conserved domains of the multidrug efflux transporter. Screening of isolates from humans and pigs for genes located on pMAH135 revealed that the detection rate of these genes was higher in clinical isolates from pulmonary MAC disease patients than in those from HIV-positive patients, whereas the genes were almost entirely absent in isolates from pigs. Moreover, variable number tandem repeats typing analysis showed that isolates carrying pMAH135 genes are grouped in a specific cluster. Collectively, the pMAH135 plasmid contains genes associated with M. avium's pathogenicity and resistance to antimicrobial agents.

This raises two ethical dilemmas: the question of whether we are justified in increasing the danger to a present, named, patient so as to benefit future, unknown, patients; and whether we are allowed to do so without asking the present patient for consent. Although the considerations for healthy elderly patients are similar to younger adults, the answers are complex when addressing patients with dementia, severely reduced quality of life and at end of life. We argue that a public debate on the balance between benefit to a present patient versus harm to future patients should be conducted. Such a debate should include examinations of scenarios in which antibiotic treatment does not gain any benefit in a patient with infection: at the end of life; in situations in which resistance is such that empirical antibiotic treatment seldom matches the susceptibilities of the pathogen; and in patients with no quality of life. An explicit cost-benefit model, incorporating quality of life and risk of resistance, in computerized decision support might obviate a clinician's need to deal with these difficult issues at bedside.",Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,2015,L Leibovici; M Paul,"['Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Ethics, Pharmacy', 'Health Services for the Aged', 'Humans', 'Inappropriate Prescribing', 'Quality of Life']","['Antibiotic stewardship', 'cost of resistance', 'decision support', 'elderly', 'ethics']",2

We reviewed existing evidence on the impact of CDSS on antimicrobial prescribing. Based on the results of our literature search, we discuss the use of CDSS for antimicrobial management in hospitals and antibiotic prescribing practices in ambulatory primary care settings. We identify some of the issues surrounding selecting and defining appropriate outcome measures for assessing the impact of CDSS on antimicrobial prescribing in the hospital setting. In the primary care setting, we observed that CDSS has a modest impact in changing antibiotic prescribing practice, which could be related to the underutilization of antimicrobial CDSS.",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Tahani Nageeti; Raghad Al-Harbi; Khalid Al-Malki; Omnia Natto; Abdulla Binhamdan; Hanan Aldosari; Bakheet Aldosari; Fares Alshammari; Abdullah Alanazi,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Decision Support Systems, Clinical', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Primary Health Care']","['Antibiotic', 'antimicrobial', 'computerized decision support system']",2
31071456,Impact of expert knowledge on the detection of patients at risk of antimicrobial therapy failure by clinical decision support systems.,"Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests (ASTs) are performed in hospitals to detect whether an infectious agent is resistant or susceptible to a set of antimicrobials. When AST results are available, the evaluation of the patient's antimicrobial therapy is a critical task to ensure its effectiveness against the found microorganism. Since not all the available antimicrobials can be tested in ASTs, clinicians rely on their expert knowledge to complement AST results and prescribe the most appropriate antimicrobials for each infection. Our goal is to help physicians in this task by improving the detection of antimicrobial therapies at risk of failure by Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs). With this aim, we have incorporated the EUCAST expert rules in antimicrobial susceptibility testing into a CDSS to improve the results of ASTs. In order to achieve this, we have combined both ontologies and production rules. Furthermore, we have evaluated the impact of EUCAST expert rules on the detection of antimicrobial therapies at risk of failure. We performed a retrospective study with one year of clinical data, obtaining a total of 148 alerts from which 62 (41.9%) were based on the additional expert knowledge. Furthermore, the evaluation of the clinical relevance of 27 alerts resulted in 8 of them (29.7%) being clinically relevant. Of these, 6 were based on expert knowledge. Finally, an alarm fatigue study suggests that waiting between 48 and 72 h from the reception of the AST results can significantly reduce the number of alerts that are unnecessary in our CDSS because they are already being addressed in the hospital's daily workflow. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the incorporation of expert knowledge improves the capabilities of CDSSs as regards detecting the risk of antimicrobial therapy failure, which may improve the institutional outcomes in antimicrobial stewardship.",Journal of biomedical informatics,2019,Bernardo Cánovas-Segura; Antonio Morales; Jose M Juarez; Manuel Campos; Francisco Palacios,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Decision Support Systems, Clinical', 'Humans', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Failure']","['Antimicrobial susceptibility testing', 'Clinical decision support systems', 'Knowledge representation and reasoning', 'Ontologies', 'Production rules']",2

These guidelines recommend that stewardship programs employ the science of pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) as well as adopting computerized decision support technologies when possible. The United States Food and Drug Administration have adopted PK-PD as a cornerstone in the evaluation of antimicrobial agents during clinical development. The core principles of PK-PD center around describing the relationship between drug exposure indexed to the susceptibility of the infecting bacterial pathogen and patient response. Using such relationships with population pharmacokinetic models and simulation, rational drug and dosing regimens can be selected. But because PK-PD modeling and simulation programs are generally absent in clinical practice, systematic application of this science is missing.

To update the last review on this topic, we conducted a narrative review aimed at describing all CDSSs identified through searches of Medline dedicated to antimicrobials prescribing from 2019 to 2023. All original research describing a CDSS dedicated to antimicrobials selection, including antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, and antiparasitic drugs, were eligible. CDSS goals and their potential clinical impacts, as well as characteristics of studies for CDSS evaluation (type of study, population, setting, objectives, and main findings) were extracted. Among the 28 studies included, most (N = 24) were dedicated to antibiotics and 15 were embedded in an electronic health record. Only one CDSS was developed in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The main goal of the included CDSSs was to assist clinicians in the selection of antimicrobials. Ten studies included more than 1000 patients or prescriptions, and most of them were implemented in hospitals. Only six studies reported no impact of CDSSs on antibiotic use or compliance with guidelines. CDSSs dedicated to antimicrobial prescribing is an area of increasing activity, with solutions offering the potential to optimize antimicrobial use. Although there is an urgent need to develop CDSSs, CDSS clinical evaluation appears to be an important requirement before implementation.

Objective To retrospectively evaluate time windows between both scheduled prescription and administration and reconstitution-preparation and end of administration of intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and meropenem prescriptions. Setting 37 hospital wards at a tertiary hospital, Belgium. Method All adult hospital stays with at least one amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or meropenem administration in 2018 were reviewed. Time windows were deemed acceptable if < 30 min between prescription and administration and < 90 or < 150 min between reconstitution-preparation and end of administration for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and meropenem, respectively. Main outcome measure Time windows between prescription and administration and between reconstitution-preparation and administration. Results For 50 273 administered prescriptions, both time windows were acceptable in 53.7% of first dose and 56.4% of follow-up dose administrations. 43.7% of first doses did not respect the time window between reconstitution-preparation and administration (2.8%) or between prescription and administration (40.9%). These discrepancies equalled 11.1% and 26.3% for follow-up doses, respectively. Large variation across hospital wards was observed. After the first five consecutive administrations, 93.1% of patients had not received their antibiotics within the time windows allowed. The most striking predictor of timely administration with respect to both prescription and reconstitution-preparation time was prescription synchronisation with nursing administration rounds. Conclusion For amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and meropenem, timeliness of reconstitution-preparation and administration was appropriate in approximately half of administrations.

Many hospitals have introduced ePrescribing systems but the effect on antimicrobial prescribing, without treatment choice decision support systems, has not been well described. We sought to determine whether the introduction of ePrescribing improved prescribing quality. Patient records for inpatients on four rehabilitation wards, two using ePrescribing and two using the National Medication Chart, during February 2017, were retrospectively reviewed to identify all antimicrobial prescriptions, which were then reviewed for quality. Documentation of indication was significantly better on ePrescribing wards (45/46, 98%) compared to National Medication Chart wards (47/59, 80%). Adherence to guidelines (32/46, 70% vs 33/59, 56%), appropriateness of therapy (42/46, 91% vs 50/59, 85%) and documentation of duration, stop or review dates (35/46, 76% vs 38/59, 64%) did not significantly differ. ePrescribing can improve the quality of antimicrobial prescribing when Antimicrobial Stewardship principles are used in system customisation but cannot address all factors impacting on prescribing quality.",Health informatics journal,2020,Tayla R Bowers; Eamon J Duffy,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Electronic Prescribing', 'Hospitals, Urban', 'Humans', 'Prescriptions', 'Retrospective Studies']","['Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'anti-bacterial agents', 'antibiotic resistance', 'electronic health records', 'electronic prescribing', 'guideline adherence']",2

28756579,Evaluation of effects of an operational multidisciplinary team on antibiotic use in the medium to long term at a French university hospital.,"Background Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major public health problem throughout the world. In 2006, in accordance with the national guidelines for antibiotic use, the CHRU of Nancy created an operational multidisciplinary antibiotic team at one of its sites. In 2011, a cluster-controlled trial showed that the operational multidisciplinary antibiotic team (the intervention) had a favourable short-term effect on antibiotic use and costs. Objective Our objective was to determine whether these effects continued over the medium to long term (that is, 2-7 years after creation of the operational multidisciplinary antibiotic team, 2009-2014). Setting The 1800-bed University Hospital of Nancy (France). Method The effect in the medium to long term is measured according to the same criteria and assessed by the same methods as the first study. A cluster controlled trial was performed on the period 2009-2014. The intervention group comprised 11 medical and surgical wards in settings where the operational multidisciplinary antibiotic team was implemented and the control group comprised 6 wards without this operational team. Main outcome measure Consumption of antibiotics overall and by therapeutic class (in defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days) and costs savings (in €). Results The reduction in antibiotic use and costs continued, but at a lower rate than in the short term (11% between 2009 and 2014 compared with 33% between 2007 and 2009) at the site of the intervention. The principal decreases concerned fluoroquinolones and glycopeptides. At the site without an operational multidisciplinary antibiotic team (the control group), total antibiotic use remained stable. Between 2009 and 2014, costs fell 10.5% in the intervention group and 5.7% in the control group. Conclusion This study shows that it is possible to maintain the effectiveness over time of such an intervention and demonstrates its role in defining a hospital's antibiotic policy.",International journal of clinical pharmacy,2017,Béatrice Demoré; Pauline Humbert; Emmanuelle Boschetti; Sibylle Bevilacqua; Isabelle Clerc-Urmès; Thierry May; Céline Pulcini; Nathalie Thilly,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Drug Utilization', 'France', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Patient Care Team', 'Time Factors']","['Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial stewardship intervention', 'Consumption', 'DDD', 'France', 'Intervention', 'Multidisciplinary team']",2
28480245,Using Procalcitonin to Guide Antibiotic Therapy.,"Procalcitonin levels rise in response to systemic inflammation, especially of bacterial origin. Multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that procalcitonin-based algorithms can safely reduce antibiotic use in 2 clinical scenarios. First, in stable, low-risk patients with respiratory infections, procalcitonin levels of <0.25 µg/L can guide the decision to withhold antibiotics or stop therapy early. Second, in critically ill patients with suspected sepsis, clinicians should not initially withhold antibiotics, but procalcitonin levels of <0.5 µg/L or levels that decrease by ≥80% from peak can guide discontinuation once patients stabilize. The recent stop antibiotics on procalcitonin guidance study (SAPS), the largest procalcitonin trial to date, demonstrated reduction in both antibiotic exposure and mortality in critically ill patients. Although procalcitonin is ready for routine use, future research should examine optimal strategies for implementation in hospitals, its real-world impact on clinical outcomes and costs, its applicability to immunocompromised patients, and the generalizability of trials to the US population.",Open forum infectious diseases,2017,Chanu Rhee,[],"['antibiotic stewardship', 'biomarkers', 'procalcitonin', 'respiratory infections', 'sepsis.']",2

31692076,Impact of infection control measures on the related costs and the amount of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents used in a hospital: A time-series analysis.,"Health care-associated infections (HAIs) worsen patient prognoses and increase medical costs. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS), which involves appropriate use of antimicrobial agents and antiseptics, may be beneficial for addressing the issue of HAIs. In hospitals, an infection control team (ICT) plays an important role on the appropriate use of antimicrobial agents and antiseptics based on AMS. We aimed to conduct a time-series analysis of the efficacies of infection control measures in terms of related costs, amount of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents used (carbapenems and quinolones), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) detection rates. This retrospective cross-sectional study included in-hospital patients treated at a single institute between January 2012 and December 2015. The intervention start point (initiation of infection control measures) was January 2014. All survey items were subjected to segmented regression analysis using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. Differences between pre-intervention and postintervention levels and their trends were assessed, using a statistical significance cutoff of P < .05. The infection control costs demonstrated a significantly increasing trend, despite significant decreases in the amount of carbapenems used. Accordingly, the implementation of infection control measures was associated with increased costs, whereas carbapenem use decreased immediately after intervention. Postintervention levels, trends of quinolone use, or MRSA detection rates did not reveal significant changes. Although implementation of infection control measures induced gradual increases in related costs, these measures led to immediate reductions in carbapenem use. Our study findings will support the establishment of more effective and economical infection control measures.",The International journal of health planning and management,2020,Tomoya Tachi; Yumi Toda; Takayuki Seko; Yoshihiro Noguchi; Hitomi Teramachi,"['Anti-Infective Agents', 'Cross Infection', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Hospital Costs', 'Humans', 'Infection Control', 'Interrupted Time Series Analysis', 'Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Staphylococcal Infections', 'Time Factors']","['antimicrobial agents', 'autoregressive integrated moving average model', 'infection control activity', 'infection control costs', 'time-series analysis']",2

The results of this study will be used to create evidence-based treatment guidelines. PICOs (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome) were generated by a multidisciplinary expert panel taking into account opinions from stakeholders (general practitioners and dog owners). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to evaluate the certainty of the evidence. The systematic search yielded six randomised controlled trials (RCT) for antimicrobial treatment and six RCTs for nutraceutical treatment meeting the eligibility criteria. Categories of disease severity (mild, moderate, and severe) were created based on the presence of systemic signs and response to fluid therapy. Outcomes included duration of diarrhoea, duration of hospitalization, progression of disease, mortality, and adverse effects. High certainty evidence showed that antimicrobial treatment did not have a clinically relevant effect on any outcome in dogs with mild or moderate disease. Certainty of evidence was low for dogs with severe disease. Nutraceutical products did not show a clinically significant effect in shortening the duration of diarrhoea (based on very low to moderate certainty evidence). No adverse effects were reported in any of the studies.","Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)",2024,K Scahill; L R Jessen; C Prior; D Singleton; F Foroutan; A A Ferran; C Arenas; C R Bjørnvad; E Lavy; F Allerton; J S Weese; K Allenspach; L Guardabassi; S Unterer; T Bodnárová; U Windahl; M L Brennan; M Werner,"['Dogs', 'Animals', 'Diarrhea', 'Dog Diseases', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Probiotics', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Acute Disease', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents']","['Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'Antimicrobial stewardship', 'Evidence-based', 'Metronidazole', 'Probiotics']",2
38000711,Randomized control trial on impact of clinical pharmacist led interventions on antibiotic stewardship program in children 0 to 18 years age in a tertiary care hospital in southern India.,"A prospective randomized controlled interventional study was conducted at a quaternary care multispecialty hospital in South India with the primary objective of identifying opportunities to improve antibiotic prescribing patterns in neonates, children, and adolescents. The hospital has a robust clinical pharmacist program wherein antibiotic prescriptions were checked for appropriateness of antibiotic dose, route, formulation, duration of therapy, and IV to oral switch. These characteristics of antibiotic use were therefore similar in the 75 children in the control and 75 in the intervention group. The additional clinical pharmacist interventions analyzed in this study included checking if a provisional diagnosis had been made before initiating antibiotics, ensuring that appropriate cultures were sent before starting antibiotics, time taken to optimize antibiotic therapy in accordance to the culture sensitivity report and whether the indication for antibiotics use was as per Indian Acdemy of Pediatrics (IAP) Drug Formulary recommendations. The main outcomes were that all these parameters except the first (all children had a clinical diagnosis before initiating antibiotic/s) were better in the intervention group and there was a significant reduction in the total antibiotic days, an increase in antibiotic-free days, and an improvement in the appropriateness of duration of antibiotic therapy and frequency of the antibiotic dosing. However, since the incidence of severe sepsis was higher in the intervention group, broad-spectrum and restricted antibiotics were used, and thus treatment costs were higher in this group. The results indicate that despite already existing clinical pharmacist interventions, additional ones could further improve antibiotic prescription accuracy significantly; and re-emphasized the need to employ trained pediatric general and subspecialty clinical pharmacists in sufficient numbers to implement a successful pediatric antibiotic stewardship program in a hospital.",American journal of infection control,2024,Jeeson C Unni; Manas Chacko; Juby Jacob; Anup Warrier,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Drug Utilization', 'India', 'Pharmacists', 'Prospective Studies', 'Tertiary Care Centers']","['Adolescents', 'Antibiotics', 'Neonates']",2
29025194,Procalcitonin to initiate or discontinue antibiotics in acute respiratory tract infections.,"Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) comprise of a large and heterogeneous group of infections including bacterial, viral, and other aetiologies. In recent years, procalcitonin (PCT), a blood marker for bacterial infections, has emerged as a promising tool to improve decisions about antibiotic therapy (PCT-guided antibiotic therapy). Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the feasibility of using procalcitonin for starting and stopping antibiotics in different patient populations with ARIs and different settings ranging from primary care settings to emergency departments, hospital wards, and intensive care units. However, the effect of using procalcitonin on clinical outcomes is unclear.

31897840,Early onset sepsis calculator implementation is associated with reduced healthcare utilization and financial costs in late preterm and term newborns.,"The neonatal early onset sepsis (EOS) calculator is a novel tool for antibiotic stewardship in newborns, associated with a reduction of empiric antibiotic treatment for suspected EOS. We studied if implementation of the EOS calculator results in less healthcare utilization and lower financial costs of suspected EOS. For this, we compared two single-year cohorts of hospitalizations within 3 days after birth in a Dutch nonacademic teaching hospital, before and after implementation of the EOS calculator. All admitted newborns born at or after 35 weeks of gestation were eligible for inclusion. We analyzed data from 881 newborns pre-implementation and 827 newborns post-implementation. We found significant reductions in EOS-related laboratory tests performed and antibiotic days, associated with implementation of the EOS calculator. Mean length of hospital stay was shorter, and EOS-related financial costs were lower after implementation among term, but not among preterm newborns.Conclusion: In addition to the well-known positive impact on antibiotic stewardship, implementation of the EOS calculator is also clearly associated with reductions in healthcare utilization related to suspected EOS in late preterm and term newborns and with a reduction in associated financial costs among those born term.What is Known:• The early-onset sepsis (EOS) calculator is a novel tool for antibiotic stewardship in newborns, associated with a reduction in empiric antibiotic treatment for suspected EOS.What is New:• In newborns at risk for EOS, EOS calculator implementation is associated with a significant reduction in laboratory investigations related to suspected EOS and significantly shorter stay in those born term.• EOS calculator implementation in term newborns is associated with a mean reduction of €207 in costs for EOS-related care per admitted newborn.",European journal of pediatrics,2020,Niek B Achten; Douwe H Visser; Ellen Tromp; Wim Groot; Johannes B van Goudoever; Frans B Plötz,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Clinical Decision Rules', 'Controlled Before-After Studies', 'Hospital Costs', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Premature', 'Length of Stay', 'Neonatal Sepsis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment']","['Costs', 'EOS calculator', 'Early-onset sepsis', 'Healthcare utilization', 'Newborn']",2

36418406,Effects of implementing a clinical pathway on antibiotic prophylaxis for patients who underwent an elective surgery.,"A reduction in the unnecessary use of antibiotic prophylaxis can prevent antibiotic resistance and adverse drug events. We aimed to evaluate the effects of implementing clinical pathways (CPs) on adherence to a systematic and appropriate duration of antibiotic prophylaxis. We identified 61 eligible CPs and a total of 44,062 patients who underwent elective surgeries associated with CPs. The Poisson mixed model with an interrupted time-series analysis frame was applied to the patient-level data. This enabled a comparison of the adherence rate before and after CP implementation. Furthermore, we examined the effect of application or completion of CP on the adherence rate after implementation. Adherence to the antibiotic prophylaxis guideline substantially increased (incident rate ratio [IRR] 8.05; 95 confidence interval [CI] 2.64-24.55), compared with that before implementation. Following the implementation into the electronic entry system, we observed an improved adherence not only in CP completion but also in attempted CP execution (IRR of the executed but not completed cases 1.54; 95% CI 1.17-2.04; IRR of the executed and competed cases, 1.94; 95% CI 1.4-2.69). The implementation of CP into the electronic prescribing system was associated with a significant increase in the appropriate use of antibiotic prophylaxis among patients who underwent elective surgeries. The results suggest that a computer-assisted CP system for electronic health records could improve antibiotic adherence without significant expense.",Scientific reports,2022,Somin Park; Sooyeon Kim; Hong Bin Kim; Sang Woong Youn; Soyeon Ahn; Kidong Kim,"['Humans', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Critical Pathways', 'Elective Surgical Procedures', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Records']",[],2

28270901,Proper use of antibiotics: situation of linezolid at the intensive care unit of the Tunisian Military Hospital.,"Linezolid was introduced in clinical practice in the early 2000s. It was considered to be an ideal reserve drug for treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. (VRE) and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA). The aim of our study was to describe and evaluate the use of linezolid in clinical practice at the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Tunisian military hospital. This is a thirty-month retrospective study including patients treated with linezolid at the ICU of the Tunisian military hospital. Data collection was realized using the patients' medical files and prescriptions. A pharmacist conducted an extended medication history and checked if an advice from an infectious disease-physician and a microbiological documentation were requested. A total of 80 patients were included. Forty-one per cent of indications were outside the Marketing Authorization (MA) criteria, and were mainly sepsis and postoperative mediastinitis (32% and 4% of total prescriptions, respectively). This antibiotic was used as a first-line therapy in 58% of cases. The advice from an infectious-disease physician was requested for 33% of prescriptions. Only 20% of infections were documented microbiologically, of which 35% were caused by methicillin resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Linezolid is an interesting therapeutic alternative in case of infections due to multi-resistant bacteria and/or complex clinical situations. Therefore, its prescription must be rationalized in order to slow down the emergence of resistance to this antibiotic.

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of a selective antibiotic susceptibility reporting intervention on broad-spectrum intravenous (i.v.) antibiotic use in seven hospitals of a health system in New Jersey. This was a retrospective pre- and post-intervention ecological study. Standardised selective antibiotic susceptibility reporting rules were developed and implemented between January 2016 and June 2017. The 8 months before and after each individual hospital's implementation constituted the pre- and post-intervention study periods. The primary outcome was the rate of broad-spectrum i.v. antibiotic use for hospital-onset/multidrug-resistant infections (broad MDR). Secondary outcome measures were the use rates of non-glycopeptide anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (anti-MRSA) agents, carbapenems, non-carbapenem antipseudomonal β-lactams, third-generation cephalosporins, first/second-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and narrow-spectrum penicillins. Antibiotic use data were collected as inpatient i.v. antibiotic days of therapy per 1000 patient days (DOT/1000-PD). Interrupted time series analysis with segmented regression was used to compare outcomes. There was no significant change in the use of broad MDR agents (slope change, +0.54 DOT/1000-PD per month, 95% confidence interval -1.78 to 2.87) or other antibiotic classes. Whilst the implementation of selective antibiotic susceptibility reporting across seven hospitals had no impact on overall broad-spectrum i.v. antibiotic use, further study is needed to determine the long-term impact of this intervention.",International journal of antimicrobial agents,2019,Steven Smoke; Karan Raja; Navaneeth Narayanan; Luigi Brunetti,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Drug Utilization', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Interrupted Time Series Analysis', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'New Jersey', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Retrospective Studies']","['Antibiotic use', 'Antimicrobial stewardship', 'Broad-spectrum antibiotics', 'Cascade antibiotic susceptibility reporting', 'Selective antibiotic susceptibility reporting']",1

This consensus covers: (1) contrast-associated AKI; (2) drug-induced nephrotoxicity; (3) prevention of drug-associated AKI; (4) follow up after AKI; (5) re-initiation of medication after AKI. Strategies for the avoidance of contrast media related AKI, including peri-procedural hydration, sodium bicarbonate solutions, oral N-acetylcysteine, and iso-osmolar/low-osmolar non-ionic iodinated contrast media have been recommended, given the respective evidence levels. Regarding anticoagulants, both warfarin and new oral anticoagulants have potential nephrotoxicity, and dosage should be reduced if renal pathology exam proves renal injury. Recommended strategies to prevent drug related AKI have included assessment of 5R/(6R) reactions - risk, recognition, response, renal support, rehabilitation and (research), use of AKI alert system and computerized decision support. In terms of antibiotics-associated AKI, avoiding concomitant administration of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, monitoring vancomycin trough level, switching from vancomycin to teicoplanin in high-risk patients, and replacing conventional amphotericin B with lipid-based amphotericin B have been shown to reduce drug related AKI.

Phage therapy has emerged as a promising alternative due to the increasing prevalence of multidrug resistance UPEC strains. In this study, we isolated and characterized a novel phage, vB_EcoP_P64441, which lysed UPEC, including serogroup O75. The phage can survive from 4 to 50 °C and a pH range of 3-11. The optimal MOI was 1, latent period was 4 min, and burst size was 10 PFU/cell. Whole genome sequencing revealed that it consisted of 42,960 base pairs that encoded 53 CDSs, with no lysogenic, toxin, or tRNA-associated genes detected. vB_EcoP_P64441 was classified as a new species within the family Autographiviridae, subfamily Slopekvirinae. The results of the inhibition experiments showed that vB_EcoP_P64441 had a good suppression effect on the growth of planktonic UPEC. Phage either alone or in combination with cefotaxime was effective in inhibiting biofilm formation of UPEC in vitro. Phage strongly inhibited bacterial growth on disposable rubber catheters and limited biofilm formation within 24 h. Cellular infection experiments showed that pretreatment phage could effectively inhibit UPEC adhesion to bladder epithelial cells with safety and reduce the cellular damage caused by UPEC. Our results suggest that vB_EcoP_P64441 is a novel and effective phage for UPEC inhibition with promising applications.",Virology,2025,Xiaoyue Li; Sixiang Xu; Libin Tan; Xiaona Yan; Xin Wang; Zhuojun Li; Long Chen; Wei Zhang,"['Uropathogenic Escherichia coli', 'Biofilms', 'Urinary Tract Infections', 'Humans', 'Escherichia coli Infections', 'Genome, Viral', 'Coliphages', 'Phage Therapy', 'Bacteriophages', 'Whole Genome Sequencing']","['Bacteriophage therapy', 'Biofilms', 'Multidrug resistant (MDR)', 'Phage-antibiotic synergy', 'Uropathogenic Escherichia coli']",1
40103606,Automated dispensing cabinets and the effect on omitted doses of ward stock medicines; can implementation reduce delays to first dose antimicrobials?,"Omitted doses are a subset of medication administration errors which have the potential to cause severe harm. Sepsis is a clinical condition where dose omissions or delays in medicines administration can be fatal. Automated dispensing cabinets (ADCs) provide a medicines management solution which keeps track of stock in real time and can automatically generate orders, reducing the likelihood of medication stockouts. This study aims to assess the impact of ADC implementation on the rate of omitted doses due to unavailability of ward stock medicines. Secondary aims are to investigate the effect of ADCs on omitted doses of first dose antimicrobials. Due doses data was compiled from the electronic prescribing and medicines administration (EPMA) system for ten wards pre-ADC implementation between July and September 2022 and was compared with data post-ADC implementation between July and September 2023. Omitted doses were selected and filtered for those marked 'drug not available'. Ward stock lists were used to determine which omitted doses were for medicines held as ward stock. A secondary analysis filtered this data further to isolate omitted doses of ward stock medicines which were systemically administered antimicrobials. The overall number of prescribed doses during the pre-implementation period was comparable to those in the post-implementation period. There was a total of 393 omitted doses of ward stocked medicines due to unavailability pre-ADC implementation, and 817 post-ADC implementation. This represents an omission rate due to unavailability of ward stock medicines as a percentage of all prescribed doses, of 0.08 % pre-ADC and 0.18 % post-ADC implementation.

33045386,Impact of a Clostridioides Difficile Testing Computerized Clinical Decision Support Tool on an Adult Stem Cell Transplantation and Hematologic Malignancies Unit.,"Clostridioides difficile infection rates are higher in hospitalized hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients and patients with hematologic malignancy (HM) compared with the general population. This is related both to extensive exposure to antibiotics as well as to frequent and often prolonged hospitalization. In this population, with numerous potential causes of diarrhea, a subset of C difficile detected is presumed to represent colonization rather than clinical infection. The use of decision support tools to guide ordering in hospitalized patients has been reported to decrease both C difficile testing and detection rates. Following implementation of a computerized decision support tool on our HSCT/HM unit, we observed a >2-fold decrease in C difficile testing volume and National Healthcare Safety Network-defined laboratory identifications of C difficile. Furthermore, the rate of oral vancomycin use, as well as the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci colonization and bloodstream infection, decreased in the postintervention period.",Transplantation and cellular therapy,2021,Chad D Nix; William B Messer; Molly L Hale; James S Lewis; Lynne M Strasfeld,"['Adult', 'Clostridioides', 'Clostridioides difficile', 'Decision Support Systems, Clinical', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Retrospective Studies']","['CDI', 'Clostridioides difficile', 'Computerized clinical decision support', 'Diagnostic stewardship', 'Vancomycin', 'Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus']",1

The specialists of the De Martinis Telemedicine Panel, addressing e-health issues, have been responding to the requests of general practitioners in 14 municipalities of Marche region, by implementing the televideoconsultation to 98 patients, 68 of whom with, certain, probable or supposed to be CoViD-19 infection. The patients were managed from remote until the symptoms were over. Sixty-five patients adhere the televideoconsultation completely and were cured, also with home oxygen therapy and other treatments additional to the standard anti-inflammatory and antibiotic drugs. However, they got stuck to full isolation while making use of no external human resources for health and relying entirely on the electronic prescription of their general practitioner and the help of the cohabiting family members. Two patients abandoned, including one owing to the lack of support from the cohabiting family member, and addressed themselves to the hospital care. However, they required no mechanical ventilation and were discharged being recovered within shortly. One over 90 years' old patient was hospitalised in agreement with the general practitioner for management problems. The results are discussed in relationship to the procedures put in practice, to the perspectives in the use of clinical televideoconsultation in the Italian health system, mainly in support to the primary health care, and to the limitations due to the poor development of other e-health tools such as the citizen's electronic health record.",Recenti progressi in medicina,2020,Pierpaolo Morosini; Nando Campanella; Gina Lucci; Amedeo Giorgetti; Vanni Lorenzetti; Ercolano Manfrini; Alfredo Moretti,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Betacoronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronavirus Infections', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Electronic Prescribing', 'Female', 'General Practice', 'Home Care Services', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxygen Inhalation Therapy', 'Pandemics', 'Pneumonia, Viral', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Telemedicine', 'Videoconferencing', 'Young Adult', 'COVID-19 Drug Treatment']",[],1

Whole blood (WB) transfusion has been proposed as an alternative modality for hemostatic resuscitation of traumatic major bleeding. To assess the efficacy and safety of WB in trauma-associated massive bleeding, we performed a systematic review of the literature. We selected studies comparing WB transfusions to transfusion of blood components (COMP) in massive trauma bleeding; both randomized clinical trial (RCT) and observational studies were considered. The outcomes were mortality (30-day/in-hospital and 24-h mortality) and adverse events/transfusion reactions. The effect sizes were crude odds ratio (OR), adjusted OR and hazard ratio (HR). The methodological quality of studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs, and the ROBIN-1 tool for observational studies. The overall quality of the available evidence was assessed with the GRADE system. One RCT (2 reports) and 6 cohort studies were included (3642 adult patients; 675 receiving WB, 2967 receiving COMP). Three studies were conducted in military setting, and 4 in civilian setting. In the overall analysis, 30-day/in-hospital and 24-h mortality did not differ significantly between groups (very low quality of the evidence due to high risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency). After adjustment for baseline covariates in three cohort studies, the OR for mortality was significantly lower in WB recipients compared to COMP (OR 0.22; 95% CIs 0.10/0.45) (moderate grade of evidence). Adverse events and transfusion reactions were overlooked and not consistently reported.

Typical clinical scenarios in which antibiotics are inappropriately prescribed include response to nonspecific signs and symptoms and/or a positive urine test in the absence of symptoms referable to the urinary tract.

A fast-track workflow including MALDI-TOF species identification and two lateral flow immunochromatographic assays for the detection of CTX-M-p and CA-p directly from BCs was performed in parallel with conventional routine, and results were compared. A total of 236 BCs of patients suffering from EB BSI were included. Accuracy of the fast-track workflow ranged from 99.6 to 100%. Among E. coli isolates, CTX-M-p (20.5%) were susceptible to ceftolozane-tazobactam (C/T, 97%), ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA, 100%), and piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP, 84.8%), whereas CTX-M-and-main-carbapenemases-non-producer (CTX-M-CA-np, 79.5%) isolates were susceptible to all the antibiotics tested. Among K. pneumoniae isolates, CTX-M-p (23.3%) were poorly susceptible to TZP (40%) but widely susceptible to C/T (90%), CZA (100%), and amikacin (90%), whereas CTX-M-CA-np (55.8%) were also susceptible to cefepime. CA-p K. pneumoniae (20.9%) were susceptible to CZA (88.9%). All the species other than E. coli and K. pneumoniae were CTX-M-CA-np and were widely susceptible to the antibiotics tested except for isolates of the inducible and derepressed AmpC- or AmpC/ESBL-p species.

25163858,Characterization of the morphology and genome of an Escherichia coli podovirus.,"Escherichia coli is an important opportunistic pathogen. It can cause sepsis and severe infection. The application of lytic bacteriophages to treat infectious diseases is an alternative to antibiotics. A lytic Escherichia coli phage, designated IME-EC2, was isolated from hospital sewage. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that IME-EC2 to be a member of the family Podoviridae. It had a 60-nm head and a 15-nm tail. Here, we present the complete genome sequence of this phage, which consists of 41,510 bp with an overall G+C content of 59.2 %. A total of 60 coding sequences (CDS) were identified, and the phage genome does not contain any tRNA genes. Forty percent of the unknown CDSs are unique to IME-EC2. This phage does not show significant similarity to other phages at the DNA level, which suggests that IME-EC2 could be a novel phage. One of the unique features identified in the IME-EC2 genome was a gene coding for a putative colanic-acid-degrading protein, which could allow the phage to degrade bacterial capsule and biofilms. Another unique feature is that IME-EC2 does not contain a terminase small subunit, which suggests that this phage may have a unique packaging mechanism. The present work provides novel information on phages and shows that this lytic phage or its products could be exploited to destroy bacterial biofilms and pathogenic E. coli.",Archives of virology,2014,Yuhui Hua; Xiaoping An; Guangqian Pei; Shasha Li; Wei Wang; Xiaomeng Xu; Huahao Fan; Yong Huang; Zhiyi Zhang; Zhiqiang Mi; Jiankui Chen; Jingyun Li; Feixiong Zhang; Yigang Tong,"['Base Composition', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Coliphages', 'DNA, Viral', 'Escherichia coli', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genome, Viral', 'Hospitals', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Podoviridae', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology', 'Sewage', 'Virion']",[],1

The objectives of this study were to quantify the proportion of differing antimicrobial susceptibility patterns (dASP) among PV and to identify species and antimicrobial compounds that are mostly affected. All PV from routine diagnostics (University Hospital Münster, Germany; 1 September 2019 to 31 August 2020) were subjected to species identification (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry [MALDI-TOF MS]) and AST (Vitek 2). To assess the dASP, only antimicrobial agents were considered for which Vitek-derived MIC were available (interpreted according to the EUCAST clinical breakpoints).

DESIGN We completed a 3-arm randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of 2 types of antimicrobial-impregnated clothing compared to standard HCP clothing. Cultures were obtained from each nurse participant, the healthcare environment, and patients during each shift. The primary outcome was the change in total contamination on nurse scrubs, measured as the sum of colony-forming units (CFU) of bacteria. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING Nurses working in medical and surgical ICUs in a 936-bed tertiary-care hospital. INTERVENTION Nurse subjects wore standard cotton-polyester surgical scrubs (control), scrubs that contained a complex element compound with a silver-alloy embedded in its fibers (Scrub 1), or scrubs impregnated with an organosilane-based quaternary ammonium and a hydrophobic fluoroacrylate copolymer emulsion (Scrub 2). Nurse participants were blinded to scrub type and randomly participated in all 3 arms during 3 consecutive 12-hour shifts in the intensive care unit. RESULTS In total, 40 nurses were enrolled and completed 3 shifts. Analyses of 2,919 cultures from the environment and 2,185 from HCP clothing showed that scrub type was not associated with a change in HCP clothing contamination (P=.70). Mean difference estimates were 0.118 for the Scrub 1 arm (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.206 to 0.441; P=.48) and 0.009 for the Scrub 2 rm (95% CI, -0.323 to 0.342; P=.96) compared to the control. HCP became newly contaminated with important pathogens during 19 of the 120 shifts (16%). CONCLUSIONS Antimicrobial-impregnated scrubs were not effective at reducing HCP contamination. However, the environment is an important source of HCP clothing contamination.

10442042,[Laboratory automation and information technology in clinical microbiology--computerized support system and clinical competence of laboratory physician].,"Laboratory automation and new information technology have considerable potential to improve care through protocols that reduce errors and guide diagnosis and therapy. Computer-based decision-support systems are now in place in many hospitals in the USA. For example, optimal decisions about the use of antibiotics in critically ill patients require access to a large amount of complex information, therefore a computerized decision-support program linked to computer-based patient records can assist physicians in the use of antiinfective agents and improve the quality of care. The support systems can educate physicians, guide their clinical reasoning, and measure the quality of the care that they provide. The installation of the computer components of the system is relatively easy, but the human components of the system may be much more difficult to transfer from hospital to hospital. The successful operation of the system should require a high level of clinical competence in every staff member of the hospital. The project should encompass a broad range of complex clinical conditions and decision algorithms. It must not be focused solely on the sophistication of laboratory methods. We, laboratory physicians/clinical pathologists must modify our behavior effectively and accept the value and limitations of laboratory automation and information technology. We must work more closely with physicians and other health care professionals as the best clients of our clinical laboratories and establish a good collaborative partnership with them.",Rinsho byori.

About 10% of patients had RI. Among them, 54 (32%) received antibiotics (on average, 1.75 drugs per patient). Sixteen (17%) of antibiotic prescriptions required either dose adaptation or therapeutic drug monitoring. In all, only four prescriptions were adapted to renal function.

Using a pretest/posttest design, an Internet-based CDSS designed to optimize antimicrobial prescribing was pilot tested for community-acquired pneumonia in 5 rural hospitals in southwestern Idaho. An antimicrobial management team was created in each hospital to address clinicians' perception of excessive time required for direct use of the CDSS. In pooled hospital data, agreement with CDSS recommendations improved to a statistically significant level. However, inspection of data at the individual hospital level demonstrated that almost all improvement occurred in a single hospital. Failure in the other hospitals appeared to be primarily a consequence of organizational and cultural barriers. These barriers are discussed to understand keys for successful future implementation of CDSS in rural hospitals, drawing on experience with cultural barriers from other industries, specifically aviation.",American journal of medical quality : the official journal of the American College of Medical Quality,2005,Kurt B Stevenson; James Barbera; James W Moore; Matthew H Samore; Peter Houck,"['Adult', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Community-Acquired Infections', 'Decision Support Systems, Clinical', 'Drug Therapy, Computer-Assisted', 'Hospitals, Rural', 'Humans', 'Idaho', 'Internet', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pneumonia']",[],1

15742991,The design and evaluation of clinical decision support systems in the area of pharmacokinetics.,"Gentamicin, an antibiotic drug, can be used in one-sided (unilateral) Meniere's disease to end frequent attacks of spontaneous disabling vertigo. However, with incorrect dose treatment it can profoundly damage patients' inner ear and kidney. The dosage of medication and the dosage interval will affect serum concentration that results therapeutic or damage. Pharmacokinetics is the study of managing the relationship between the dosage medication, dosing interval, and serum concentration. However, due to the complicated mathematical equations of pharmacokinetics, it is rarely used in clinics. The purpose of this study was to use a pharmacokinetics model to build a prototype of gentamicin CDSS embedded in a PDA. This system was implemented in a district teaching hospital in Chiayi area, Taiwan. Empirical data was collected under routine clinical setting with real patients and physicians to validate this CDSS. The research results showed that, considering the therapeutic effect, the pharmacokinetics-based CDSS outperforms physicians' experience. Regarding the intoxication, the pharmacokinetics-based CDSS also performed better than physicians' experience with less intoxication. The physicians using the system revealed a high degree of agreement with the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and intention to use the pharmacokinetics-based CDSS.",Medical informatics and the Internet in medicine,2004,Hsin-Ginn Hwang; I-Chu Chang; Won-Fu Hung; Mao-Lin Sung; David Yen,"['Computers, Handheld', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Support Systems, Clinical', 'Gentamicins', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Meniere Disease']",[],1

We compared the performance of BF with culture. Samples from 298 hospitalized patients with suspected pneumonia routinely sent for culture were also analyzed using BF. Retrospectively, patients were clinically categorized as having ""pneumonia"" or ""no pneumonia."" BF and culture were compared by analytical performance, which was evaluated by pathogen concordance, and by clinical performance by comparing pathogen detections in patients with and without pneumonia. The BF results for viruses and atypical bacteria were not included in the performance analysis. In 298 patient samples, BF and culture detected 285 and 142 potential pathogens, respectively. Positive percent agreement (PPA) was 88% (125/142). In patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), clinical sensitivity was 70% and 51%, and specificity was 43% and 71% for BF and culture, respectively. In patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia, the corresponding numbers were 55% and 23%, and 47% and 68%. There was no significant improvement of performance, when only high-quality sputum samples were considered. Efficacy of both BF and culture was low. Both tests are best used in CAP patients for whom the diagnosis has already been clinically established. Indiscriminate use may be clinically misleading and a cause of improper use of antibiotics.","APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",2022,Vigith Andrews; Mette Pinholt; Uffe Vest Schneider; Kristian Schønning; Lillian Marie Søes; Gorm Lisby,"['Community-Acquired Infections', 'Humans', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pneumonia', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retrospective Studies']","['Bacteriology', 'FilmArray', 'clinical microbiology', 'diagnostic stewardship', 'microscopy & culture', 'molecular microbiology', 'pneumonia', 'syndromic testing']",1

Data on the optimal clinical scenarios in which to use this tool are limited. We assessed, via retrospective chart review, the rate of organism identification and impact on clinical management from BRPCR testing sent from our quaternary care children's hospital between February 2010 and June 2020. A total of 382 samples were sent from 269 individual patients. A total of 200 (74.3%) patients were immunocompromised. Median age at time of sample collection was 10.0 years (interquartile range, 4.2 to 15.8). A total of 254/377 (64.7%) samples were from patients known to be on ≥1 antimicrobial in the 24 h prior to sample collection. A total of 112/382 (29.3%) samples were from patients ultimately diagnosed with a bacterial or fungal infection by another testing modality. The most common sample types were bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (45), lung tissue (41), and bone (39). An organism was identified from 83 (21.7%) samples, but results from only 19 (5.0%) samples led to a change in management. Organisms were identified from 18 (40%) BAL samples; only 2 (4.4%) were judged to be clinically significant. A total of 4/12 (33.3%) samples from cardiac hardware changed clinical management. We found that only 5% of BRPCR results influenced antimicrobial management in a diverse pediatric cohort. Our findings suggest that the impact on clinical management varied widely by sample type.

28343455,Reducing Clostridium difficile in the Inpatient Setting: A Systematic Review of the Adherence to and Effectiveness of C. difficile Prevention Bundles.,"BACKGROUND Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common infectious cause of nosocomial diarrhea, and its prevention is an urgent public health priority. However, reduction of CDI is challenging because of its complex pathogenesis, large reservoirs of colonized patients, and the persistence of infectious spores. The literature lacks high-quality evidence for evaluating interventions, and many hospitals have implemented bundled interventions to reduce CDI with variable results. Thus, we conducted a systematic review to examine the components of CDI bundles, their implementation processes, and their impact on CDI rates. METHODS We conducted a comprehensive literature search of multiple computerized databases from their date of inception through April 30, 2016. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO, an international prospective register of systematic reviews. Bundle effectiveness, adherence, and study quality were assessed for each study meeting our criteria for inclusion. RESULTS In the 26 studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review, implementation and adherence factors to interventions were variably and incompletely reported, making study reproducibility and replicability challenging. Despite contextual differences and the variety of bundle components utilized, all 26 studies reported an improvement in CDI rates. However, given the lack of randomized controlled trials in the literature, assessing a causal relationship between bundled interventions and CDI rates is currently impossible. CONCLUSION Cluster randomized trials that include a rigorous assessment of the implementation of bundled interventions are urgently needed to causally test the effect of intervention bundles on CDI rates.

28193663,Results from a Patient-Based Health Education Intervention in Reducing Antibiotic Use for Acute Upper Respiratory Tract Infections in the Private Sector Primary Care Setting in Singapore.,"We investigated the efficacy of patient-targeted education in reducing antibiotic prescriptions for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) among adults in the private primary care setting in Singapore. Our randomized controlled trial enrolled patients aged 21 years and above presenting at general practitioner (GP) clinics with URTI symptoms for 7 days or less. Intervention arm patients were verbally educated via pamphlets about the etiology of URTIs, the role of antibiotics in treating URTIs, and the consequences of inappropriate antibiotic use. Control arm patients were educated on influenza vaccinations. Both arms were compared regarding the proportions prescribed antibiotics and the patients' postconsultation views. A total of 914 patients consulting 35 doctors from 24 clinics completed the study (457 in each arm). The demographics of patients in both arms were similar, and 19.1% were prescribed an antibiotic, but this varied from 0% to 70% for individual GPs. The intervention did not significantly reduce antibiotic prescriptions (odds ratio [OR], 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-1.73) except in patients of Indian ethnicity (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.09-0.93).

37228561,Evaluation of BioFire® FilmArray® Pneumonia Panel in Bronchoalveolar Lavage Samples From Immunocompromised Patients With Suspected Pneumonia.,"Objectives Immunocompromised patients, specifically those with solid organ transplants or cancer on chemotherapy, are at particularly high risk of severe pneumonia and opportunistic infections. In select patients, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is performed to provide high-quality samples for analysis. We compare BioFire® FilmArray® Pneumonia Panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States), a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, with standard of care diagnostics in BAL samples from immunocompromised patients to identify opportunities for this test to affect clinical decision making. Methods Patients hospitalized with pneumonia based on clinical and radiographic findings who underwent evaluation with bronchoscopy between May 2019 to January 2020 were reviewed. Among those patients undergoing bronchoscopy, those who were immunocompromised were selected for inclusion in the study. BAL specimens submitted to the microbiology laboratory were chosen based on as part of the internal validation of the panel in comparison with sputum culture at our hospitals. We compared the outcomes of the multiplex PCR assay with traditional culture methods and evaluated the role of PCR assay in de-escalating antimicrobial therapy. Results Twenty-four patients were identified for testing with the multiplex PCR assay. Of the 24 patients, 16 were immunocompromised, all with solid or hematological malignancy or a history of organ transplant. Seventeen individual BAL samples from the 16 patients were reviewed. BAL culture results and the multiplex PCR assay were in agreement in 13 samples (76.5%). In four cases, the multiplex PCR assay identified a possible causative pathogen not detected by standard workup. The median time to de-escalation of antimicrobials was three days (interquartile range (IQR) 2-4) from the day of collection of the BAL samples. Conclusions Studies have established the additive role of multiplex PCR testing in addition to traditional diagnostic tools like sputum culture in diagnosing the etiology of pneumonia. Limited data exist specifically looking at immunocompromised patients, in whom a timely and accurate diagnosis is particularly important. There is a potential benefit for performing multiplex PCR assays as an additive diagnostic tool in BAL samples for these patients.",Cureus,2023,Tony Li-Geng; Fainareti N Zervou; Maria Aguero-Rosenfeld; Ioannis M Zacharioudakis,[],"['antimicrobial stewardship', 'bronchoalveolar lavage (bal)', 'community aquired pneumonia', 'filmarray pneumonia panel', 'immunocompromised hosts', 'microbiology', 'multiplex pcr', 'transplant infections']",1

However, such treatment is associated with a risk of serious infection, in particular invasive fungal infection (IFI) associated with prolonged neutropenia. Current practice guidelines recommend primary antifungal (AF) prophylaxis to be administered to high-risk patients to reduce IFI incidence. AFs are also used empirically to manage prolonged neutropenic fever. Current strategies lead to substantial overuse of AFs. Galactomannan (GM) and β-D-glucan (BG) biomarkers are also used to diagnose IFI. Combining both biomarkers may enhance the predictability of IFI compared to administering each test alone. Currently, no large-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) has directly compared a biomarker-based diagnostic screening strategy without AF prophylaxis to AF prophylaxis (without systematic biomarker testing).",Trials,2024,Lydia Flett; Radwa Abdelatif; Sarah Akhtar Baz; Samantha Brady; Belén Corbacho; Kate Common; Abbie Cowling; Caroline Fairhurst; Ellie Fitzmaurice; Shreyans Gandhi; Andrea Hilton; William Hope; Alex Howard; Joanne Laycock; Patrick Lillie; Gemma Mitchell; Adwoa Parker; Mary Peel; Laura Sheard; Jacqueline Sneddon; Thomas Taynton; Puvan Tharmanathan; David Torgerson; Han-I Wang; David Allsup; Gavin Barlow,"['Humans', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Invasive Fungal Infections', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Biomarkers', 'Galactose', 'Mannans', 'Treatment Outcome', 'beta-Glucans', 'Antimicrobial Stewardship', 'Leukemia', 'Time Factors', 'Cost-Effectiveness Analysis']","['Acute leukaemia', 'Antifungal stewardship', 'Apergillosis', 'Beta-D-Glucan', 'Galactomannan', 'Invasive fungal infection']",1

The ABCS (aspirin-blood pressure control-cholesterol control-smoking cessation) reduce atherosclerotic (ASCVD) risk in the general population, but little is known regarding strategies for promoting the ABCS among PWH. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), we designed multilevel implementation strategies that target PWH and their clinicians to promote appropriate use of the ABCS based on a 10-year estimated ASCVD risk. Implementation strategies include patient coaching, automated texting, peer phone support, academic detailing and audit and feedback for the patient's clinician. We are evaluating implementation through a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial based on the Reach-Effectiveness-Adoption-Maintenance/Qualitative-Evaluation-for-Systematic-Translation (RE-AIM/QuEST) mixed methods framework that integrates quantitative and qualitative assessments.

The primary outcome was the time to detection (TTD) (from the loading of the sample into the incubator to the positivity signal). Patients over 16 years old suspected of having bacteremia/fungemia were included. They were divided into two strata with a total of 9,957 blood extractions. Initially, each stratum was randomly assigned to one of the incubators and then alternated every 2 weeks for 6 months. Each sample was inoculated into an aerobic bottle and an anaerobic bottle. All bottles were processed equally according to the laboratory's standard procedures after they were flagged positive. We analyzed 4,797 samples in the Virtuo system and 5,160 in the Bactec FX system.

35740164,Evaluation of a Meropenem and Piperacillin Monitoring Program in Intensive Care Unit Patients Calls for the Regular Assessment of Empirical Targets and Easy-to-Use Dosing Decision Tools.,"The drug concentrations targeted in meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam therapy also depend on the susceptibility of the pathogen. Yet, the pathogen is often unknown, and antibiotic therapy is guided by empirical targets. To reliably achieve the targeted concentrations, dosing needs to be adjusted for renal function. We aimed to evaluate a meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam monitoring program in intensive care unit (ICU) patients by assessing (i) the adequacy of locally selected empirical targets, (ii) if dosing is adequately adjusted for renal function and individual target, and (iii) if dosing is adjusted in target attainment (TA) failure. In a prospective, observational clinical trial of drug concentrations, relevant patient characteristics and microbiological data (pathogen, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)) for patients receiving meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam treatment were collected. If the MIC value was available, a target range of 1-5 × MIC was selected for minimum drug concentrations of both drugs. If the MIC value was not available, 8-40 mg/L and 16-80 mg/L were selected as empirical target ranges for meropenem and piperacillin, respectively. A total of 356 meropenem and 216 piperacillin samples were collected from 108 and 96 ICU patients, respectively. The vast majority of observed MIC values was lower than the empirical target (meropenem: 90.0%, piperacillin: 93.9%), suggesting empirical target value reductions. TA was found to be low (meropenem: 35.7%, piperacillin 50.5%) with the lowest TA for severely impaired renal function (meropenem: 13.9%, piperacillin: 29.2%), and observed drug concentrations did not significantly differ between patients with different targets, indicating dosing was not adequately adjusted for renal function or target. Dosing adjustments were rare for both drugs (meropenem: 6.13%, piperacillin: 4.78%) and for meropenem irrespective of TA, revealing that concentration monitoring alone was insufficient to guide dosing adjustment. Empirical targets should regularly be assessed and adjusted based on local susceptibility data. To improve TA, scientific knowledge should be translated into easy-to-use dosing strategies guiding antibiotic dosing.","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Ferdinand Anton Weinelt; Miriam Songa Stegemann; Anja Theloe; Frieder Pfäfflin; Stephan Achterberg; Franz Weber; Lucas Dübel; Agata Mikolajewska; Alexander Uhrig; Peggy Kiessling; Wilhelm Huisinga; Robin Michelet; Stefanie Hennig; Charlotte Kloft,[],"['antibiotics', 'antimicrobial stewardship', 'critically ill', 'meropenem', 'pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic', 'piperacillin/tazobactam']",1

While the clinical presentations are similar to those of other respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, and SARS-CoV-2, they can still lead to serious complications. The virus primarily transmits via respiratory droplets, with outbreaks peaking during winter and spring. In resource-limited settings, administration of multiplex PCR assays is essential for precise diagnosis, yet it presents significant challenges. Recent studies indicate a 6.24% infection rate in hospitalized patients presenting with acute respiratory infections (ARIs). Enhanced surveillance and prevention are essential given the morbidity and mortality rates of hMPV, which are comparable to those of influenza and RSV. Effective management requires enhanced diagnostic tools, improved public health strategies, and continuous research into antiviral therapies and vaccines.

However, there are limited published reports describing the impact of CDSS on clinical pharmacy measures. In February 2011, Good Shepherd Medical Center, a 425-bed acute care community hospital in East Texas, implemented a CDSS (TheraDoc clinical surveillance system). Prior to CDSS implementation, clinicians struggled with obtaining and documenting the data needed to support clinical initiatives. The value of having both clinical and staff pharmacists utilizing the CDSS has improved communication and knowledge among staff and improved relationships with medical staff, nursing, and case management. The department of pharmacy increased its clinical interventions from an average of 1,986 per month to 4,065 per month; this represents a 105% increase in the number of interventions. The annual estimated cost savings after CDSS implementation is $2,999,508, representing a 96% increase per year and translating into a $1,469,907 annual return on investment.",Hospital pharmacy,2013,Stacy Calloway; Hameed A Akilo; Kyle Bierman,[],"['antibiotic stewardship', 'clinical decision support system', 'costs', 'documentation', 'interventions', 'pharmacy', 'surveillance']",0

(1) Method: A retrospective observational analysis was undertaken of all hospitalised patients with COVID-19 across a single-site NHS acute Trust (London, UK) from 1 December 2020 to 28 February 2021. Electronic patient records were used to identify patients, clinical data, and outcomes. Procalcitonin (PCT) serum assays, where available on admission, were analysed against electronic prescribing records for antibacterial prescribing to determine relationships with a negative PCT result (<25 mg/L) and antibacterial course length. (2) Results: Antibacterial agents were initiated on admission in 310/624 (49.7%) of patients presenting with COVID-19. A total of 33/74 (44.5%) patients with a negative PCT on admission had their treatment stopped within 24 h. A total of 6/49 (12.2%) patients were started on antibacterials, but a positive PCT saw their treatment stopped.

40721481,The unfolded protein response influences therapy outcome and disease progression in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.,"Since genomics, epigenomics and transcriptomics have provided only a partial explanation of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) heterogeneity, and since concordance between mRNA and protein expression is incomplete, we related the CLL proteome to clinical outcome. CLL samples from patients who received fludarabine-containing chemoimmunotherapy were analysed by mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS). One dataset compared pre-treatment samples associated with an optimal versus suboptimal response, while another compared paired samples collected before treatment and at disease progression. eIF2 signalling (pivotal to the unfolded protein response (UPR)), was identified as the most enriched pathway in both datasets (respective z-scores: - 6.245 and 3.317; p < 0.0001), as well as in a fludarabine-resistant CLL cell line established from HG3 cells (z-score: - 2.121; p < 0.0001). Western blotting revealed that fludarabine-resistant HG3 cells expressed higher levels of PERK, which phosphorylates the regulatory eIF2α subunit, and lower levels of BiP, an HSP70 molecular chaperone that inactivates PERK but preferentially binds to misfolded proteins during ER stress. The PERK inhibitor, GSK2606414, sensitised resistant, but not sensitive, HG-3 cells to fludarabine without affecting background cell viability or cytotoxicity induced by the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax. These findings identify the UPR as a novel determinant of therapy outcome and disease progression in CLL.",Scientific reports,2025,Umair Tahir Khan; Kim Clarke; Gina Eagle; Melanie Oates; Peter Hillmen; Sandrine Jayne; Martin J S Dyer; Alex Phipps; Francesco Falciani; Rosalind E Jenkins; Andrew R Pettitt,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Unfolded Protein Response', 'Disease Progression', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'eIF-2 Kinase', 'Male', 'Female', 'Aged', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2', 'Middle Aged']","['CLL cells', 'Drug resistance and disease progression', 'PERK linked to resistant phenotype', 'Proteomics', 'eIF2 signalling']",0

Here, we explore the accuracy of the IMX-BVN-3/IMX-SEV-3 29 mRNA host response classifiers in simultaneously detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and bacterial coinfections and predicting clinical severity of COVID-19. A total of 161 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (52.2% female; median age, 50.0 years; 51% hospitalized; 5.6% deaths) were enrolled at the Stanford Hospital ED. RNA was extracted (2.5 mL whole blood in PAXgene blood RNA), and 29 host mRNAs in response to the infection were quantified using Nanostring nCounter. The IMX-BVN-3 classifier identified SARS-CoV-2 infection in 151 patients with a sensitivity of 93.8%. Six of 10 patients undetected by the classifier had positive COVID tests more than 9 days prior to enrollment, and the remaining patients oscillated between positive and negative results in subsequent tests.

Interpretation of a positive result can be challenging due to the need to differentiate colonisers and contaminants from clinically significant pathogens. We conducted a retrospective audit on FFPE tissue specimens that underwent panfungal PCR from January 2021 to August 2022. Panfungal PCR results from samples where fungal elements were visualised on histopathology were compared with results from samples where no fungal elements were visualised. The cost per clinically significant positive sample in each group was calculated. Of the 248 FFPE tissues sampled, 18.1% (45/248) had fungal forms seen on histopathology. Panfungal PCR was positive in 22/45 samples (48.9%), with 16 (35.6%) results deemed clinically significant. For the remaining 203 specimens, panfungal PCR was positive in 19 (9.4%) samples with only six (3.0%) clinically significant. The average cost per clinically significant result was AUD 258.13 in the histopathology positive group and AUD 3,105.22 in the histopathology negative group. Our data suggest panfungal PCR has limited clinical utility in FFPE tissue when no fungal elements are seen.

33902653,Results of the CHlorhexidine Gluconate Bathing implementation intervention to improve evidence-based nursing practices for prevention of central line associated bloodstream infections Study (CHanGing BathS): a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial.,"Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) result in approximately 28,000 deaths and approximately $2.3 billion in added costs to the U.S. healthcare system each year, and yet, many of these infections are preventable. At two large health systems in the southeast United States, CLABSIs continue to be an area of opportunity. Despite strong evidence for interventions to prevent CLABSI and reduce associated patient harm, such as use of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) bathing, the adoption of these interventions in practice is poor. The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of a tailored, multifaceted implementation program on nursing staff's compliance with the CHG bathing process and electronic health record (EHR) documentation in critically ill patients. The secondary objectives were to examine the (1) moderating effect of unit characteristics and cultural context, (2) intervention effect on nursing staff's knowledge and perceptions of CHG bathing, and (3) intervention effect on CLABSI rates.",Implementation science : IS,2021,Staci S Reynolds; Patricia Woltz; Edward Keating; Janice Neff; Jennifer Elliott; Daniel Hatch; Qing Yang; Bradi B Granger,"['Anti-Infective Agents, Local', 'Baths', 'Catheter-Related Infections', 'Chlorhexidine', 'Cross Infection', 'Evidence-Based Nursing', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Sepsis']","['Audit and feedback intervention', 'Catheter-related bloodstream infection', 'Chlorhexidine gluconate', 'Educational outreach', 'Implementation science', 'Nursing care', 'Patient bathing']",0

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has emerged as a complementary diagnostic tool capable of identifying fastidious, unexpected, or novel pathogens without prior assumptions. This narrative review synthesizes evidence from 152 studies (2015-2024), evaluating mNGS within existing diagnostic frameworks for culture-negative IE. Compared to conventional diagnostics (blood cultures, PCR, 16 S rRNA sequencing), mNGS demonstrates enhanced detection capabilities for polymicrobial infections and rare pathogens, though methodological heterogeneity across studies precludes definitive performance comparisons. Performance varies substantially based on sample type, sequencing platform, and bioinformatic pipelines. Real-world applications reveal persistent challenges, including cost barriers, interpretive complexities in low-biomass samples, and contamination risks. Integration with host-response biomarkers and AI-driven interpretation platforms shows promise for advancing clinical utility. For mNGS to be effectively integrated into routine CNE care, standardization, regulatory clarity, and equitable implementation will be essential.",Journal of epidemiology and global health,2025,Shafiu A Umar Shinge; Binbin Zhang; Baixin Zheng; Yongjia Qiang; Hussein M Ali; Youmbi T Vanessa Melchiade; Lu Zhang; Minnan Gao; Guibin Feng; Kuan Zeng; Yanqi Yang,"['Humans', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Metagenomics', 'Endocarditis']","['Antibiotic stewardship', 'Culture-negative infective endocarditis', 'Heart valve', 'Infectious disease diagnostics', 'Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS)', 'Precision medicine']",0
