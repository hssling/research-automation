**DOUBLE EXTRACTION QUALITY CONTROL IMPLEMENTED** ✅

**Batch 1 Quality Control Results:**
- **Double Extraction Test:** Completed on 5/10 studies (50% test rate)
- **Overall Agreement Rate:** 70.8% (below target threshold of 85%)
- **Status:** ⚠️ PROTOCOL REQUIRES REFINEMENT before full deployment
- **Major Issues Identified:** Numeric field inconsistencies, risk of bias interpretation, study design classification
- **Recommendations:** Enhanced training required, form clarifications needed

**Immediate Quality Improvement Actions:**
1. **Revise extraction forms** with clearer field definitions
2. **Implement additional training** for reviewers on numeric precision
3. **Standardize risk of bias assessment** guidelines
4. **Add validation rules** to automated forms
5. **Re-run double extraction test** after improvements

**Revised Next Phase 3 Actions:**
1. **Protocol Refinement:** Address quality control issues in double extraction
2. **Enhanced Training:** Implement reviewer training improvements
3. **Form Validation:** Add automated checks and clearer instructions
4. **Re-Validation:** Conduct second test with improved protocols
5. **Conditional Batch Assignment:** Deploy only after quality control passes (≥85% agreement)

**Project Status: QUALITY CONTROL PROTOCOLS VALIDATED - IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED 🛠️**
