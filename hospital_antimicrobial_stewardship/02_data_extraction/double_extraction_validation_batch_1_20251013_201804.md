## Protocol Effectiveness Assessment

## ❌ POOR - Complete Protocol Review Required

Major issues identified. Extraction protocol needs substantial revision before proceeding.
## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
- **Standardize numeric data extraction** with clear rounding rules
- **Provide clearer study design classification** guidance

### Long-term Improvements
- Implement field-specific training modules
- Add automated data validation rules to forms
- Develop decision trees for ambiguous classifications

## Data Quality Certification

**REQUIRES REVIEW:** Double extraction should be extended to additional studies before proceeding.

## Extraction Protocol Validation

- Forms structure validated ✅
- Field definitions tested ✅
- Inter-rater reliability: Needs Improvement ✅
