  Low: 68 studies

WORKFLOW CHECKLIST:
  1. Obtain full-text article (PDF/PMC)
  2. Read title and abstract for context
  3. Review methods section thoroughly
  4. Extract study characteristics
  5. Extract intervention details

  8. Document any uncertainties
  9. Cross-check all extracted data
  10. Submit for verification

QUALITY CONTROL REMINDERS:

  missing_data: Note what is missing and why
  unclear_methods: Contact corresponding author if critical
  inconsistent_results: Check for data entry errors
  protocol_deviations: Document and assess impact

  • study_characteristics
  • intervention_details
  • outcome_data
  • quality_assessment
  • extraction_notes

EXTRACTION TIPS:
  • Extract exact values, not rounded approximations
  • Note page numbers for future reference
  • Document any uncertainties or assumptions
