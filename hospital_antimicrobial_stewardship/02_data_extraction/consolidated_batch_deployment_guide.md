## üéØ Extraction Priorities

### Batch 1 Priorities:
1. mortality
2. cdi (Clostridium difficile)
3. mdro (multidrug-resistant organisms)
4. antibiotic_consumption

### Batch 2 Priorities:
1. mortality (high priority for both studies)
2. cdi (Clostridium difficile)
3. mdro (multidrug-resistant organisms)
4. antibiotic_consumption
5. length_stay

## üìÅ Deployment Package Files

### Required Files per Batch:
- `batch_{n}_studies_{timestamp}.csv` - Study list with PMIDs and priorities
- `batch_extraction_package_{timestamp}.json` - Complete structured extraction forms
- `batch_{n}_extraction_instructions_{timestamp}.txt` - Step-by-step workflow guide

### Quality Control Package:
- Double extraction: 20% of studies minimum (‚â•2 studies per batch)
- Discrepancy resolution: Third reviewer arbitration
- Agreement threshold: 100% on intervention classification and effect estimates

## üë• Recommended Reviewer Assignments

### Scenario A: Dedicated Reviewers (Optimal)
```
Batch 1 (8 studies):
- Reviewer A: STUDIES 0096, 0281, 0314 (Medical ICU/rotation focus)
- Reviewer B: STUDIES 0405, 0784, 0881 (Outreach and digital systems)
- Reviewer C: STUDIES 1198, 1317 (Checklists and mobile apps)
- Double extraction: 2 randomly selected studies

Batch 2 (2 studies):
- Reviewer D: Both studies (mortality-focused hematological interventions)
- Double extraction: 1 study minimum (both possible for quality assurance)
```

### Scenario B: Limited Reviewers (2 reviewers)
```
Batch 1 (8 studies):
- Reviewer A: STUDIES 0096, 0281, 0314, 0405 (Medical/infectious disease focus)
- Reviewer B: STUDIES 0784, 0881, 1198, 1317 (ICU/intervention focus)

Batch 2 (2 studies):
- Both reviewers: Double extract both studies for maximum quality
```

### Scenario C: Sequential Processing
```
Week 1-2: Complete Batch 2 (2 high-impact studies)
Week 3-4: Complete Batch 1 (8 medium-priority studies with mortality focus first)
```

## üìä Quality Control Workflow

### Double Extraction Protocol:
1. **Random Selection:** 20% of studies per batch selected for double extraction
2. **Independent Extraction:** Two reviewers extract independently
3. **Comparison Phase:** Third reviewer compares extractions
4. **Resolution:** Consensus agreement or senior reviewer adjudication
5. **Documentation:** All discrepancies logged with resolution rationale

### Agreement Thresholds:
- **Intervention classification:** 100% agreement required
- **Outcome definitions:** 100% agreement required
- **Effect estimates:** Within 10% agreement
- **Confidence intervals:** Within 5% agreement

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Setup Requirements

### Software Prerequisites:
- Python 3.8+ with pandas, numpy libraries
- Excel/CSV editor for form completion
- PDF reader for full-text articles
- File storage system for extraction backups

### Directory Structure:
```
