## Study Extraction Summary

### STUDY_0053 (PMID 35042878)
**Title:** The impact of antimicrobial stewardship program designed to shorten antibiotics use on the incidence of resistant bacterial infections and mortality.

**Key Findings:**
- **Design:** Interrupted Time Series (ITS) with segmented regression analysis
- **Intervention:** Prospective audit and feedback (PAF) program focusing on antibiotic shortening, dose adjustment, and IV to PO conversion
- **Setting:** Tertiary care hospital in Malaysia (2022)
- **Duration:** 24 months (12 pre + 12 post intervention)
- **Mortality Reduction:** 33.3% relative reduction (p < 0.001)
  - Pre-intervention: 1.2 per 1000 patient-days
  - Post-intervention: 0.8 per 1000 patient-days
  - Effect estimate: -0.27 (95% CI: -0.34 to -0.20)
- **Clinical Significance:** Significant reduction in hospital mortality through antibiotic optimization

### STUDY_0160 (PMID 35588970)
**Title:** Effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programmes based on rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing of haematological patients having high-risk factors for bacteraemia-related mortality: a post-hoc analysis of a randomised controlled trial.

**Key Findings:**
- **Design:** Post-hoc analysis of RCT data focusing on high-risk hematology patients
- **Intervention:** Rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST)-guided stewardship with tailored therapy, escalation/de-escalation protocols
- **Setting:** Hematology department in tertiary care hospital, Greece (2022)
- **Population:** High-risk hematological patients with bacteraemia risk factors
- **Mortality Reduction:** 42.8% relative reduction (p = 0.013)
  - Control group: 15.2% bacteraemia-related mortality
  - Intervention group: 8.7% bacteraemia-related mortality
  - Odds ratio: 0.52 (95% CI: 0.31 to 0.87)
- **Clinical Significance:** Clinically significant reduction in bacteraemia-related mortality through rapid diagnostics + stewardship

## Quality Assessment Results

### Overall Risk of Bias Ratings:
- **STUDY_0053:** Low risk across all ITS domains
- **STUDY_0160:** Low risk overall with some concerns about missing data in subset analysis

### Domain-Specific Assessments:

**STUDY_0053 (ITS Quality):**
- Secular trends: Adequate (12+12 month design, no major confounders)
- Detection bias: Adequate (consistent hospital data collection)
- Outcome completeness: Adequate (complete data reporting)
- Baseline characteristics: Similar (stable hospital setting)

**STUDY_0160 (RoB-2 Quality):**
- Randomization: Low risk (part of well-designed RCT)
- Intervention deviations: Low risk (standardized protocols)
- Missing data: Some concerns (subset analysis potential bias)
- Outcome measurement: Low risk (clear bacteraemia definition)
- Selective reporting: Low risk (clinically relevant outcomes)
