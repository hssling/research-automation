# PROSPERO Registration: Childhood Pneumonia Prevention
## PCV Schedules and Influenza Vaccination Impact on Pneumonia and Mortality

## Registration Details
**Registration ID:** Pending assignment by PROSPERO
**Date Submitted:** October 12, 2025
**Review Title:** Comparative effectiveness of different pneumococcal conjugate vaccine schedules ± influenza vaccination on pneumonia and mortality in children under 5 years: A systematic review and network meta-analysis

## Review Information
**Review Question:**
What is the comparative effectiveness of different pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) schedules (PCV10/13/15/20) ± seasonal influenza vaccination on radiologically confirmed pneumonia, all-cause LRTI admissions, and mortality in children under 5 years across low-, middle-, and high-income settings?

**Review Type:** Intervention Review
**Condition or Domain Being Studied:** Pneumonia, Lower Respiratory Tract Infections, Child Mortality

## Objectives
### Primary Objectives:
1. To compare the effectiveness of 2+1 versus 3+0 PCV schedules on radiologically confirmed pneumonia and all-cause lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) hospital admissions in children under 5 years
2. To evaluate the additional impact of seasonal influenza vaccination when combined with PCV schedules
3. To assess the impact on all-cause mortality
4. To stratify analyses by income setting (low-income countries/middle-income countries vs high-income countries)

### Secondary Objectives:
1. To evaluate serotype replacement patterns after PCV introduction
2. To assess the effectiveness of catch-up vaccination programs in different settings
3. To examine the role of effect modifiers including HIV exposure, malnutrition, baseline serotype distribution, and antibiotic access

## Types of Studies
**Types of studies to be included:**
- Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) - individual or cluster randomized
- Quasi-experimental studies (pre-post evaluation designs, interrupted time series)
- Controlled before-and-after studies
- Population-based cohort studies with strong design (propensity score matched or adequate adjustment)
- Stepped wedge cluster randomized trials

**Types of studies to be excluded:**
- Case-control studies
- Cross-sectional surveys without temporal controls
- Case reports and case series
- Qualitative studies
- Reviews and narrative summaries

## Condition or Domain Being Studied
- Target condition: Community-acquired pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infections
- Context: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduction programs
- Must include children under 5 years as primary population

## Participants/Population
- Children aged 0-59 months (primary) and up to 9 years (secondary)
- Settings: Global including low-income countries (LICs), middle-income countries (MICs), high-income countries (HICs)
- Subgroups to be examined:
  - HIV-exposed/unexposed infants
  - Malnourished children
  - Geographic regions (Africa, Asia, Americas, Europe)
  - Urban vs rural settings

## Intervention(s)
**Interventions to be assessed:**
- Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) at different schedules:
  - PCV10, PCV13, PCV15, PCV20
  - Schedule variants: 2+1 (infant doses + booster), 3+0 (3 infant doses only), 3+1 (3 infant doses + booster), catch-up programs
- Seasonal influenza vaccination combined with PCV
- Co-administration of PCV with other routine vaccines

**Comparators:**
- Placebo or no pneumococcal vaccination
- Different PCV products or schedules
- PCV alone vs PCV + influenza vaccination

## Outcome(s)
### Primary Outcomes:
1. Radiologically confirmed pneumonia (chest X-ray confirmed) incidence
2. All-cause lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) hospital admissions
3. All-cause mortality (all causes)

### Secondary Outcomes:
1. Clinically diagnosed pneumonia episodes
2. Serotype-specific pneumonia incidence
3. Pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage prevalence (vaccine-type and non-vaccine type serotypes)
4. Antimicrobial resistance patterns in pneumococcal isolates
5. Vaccine effectiveness against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD)

**Outcome assessment method:** Incidence rates, risk ratios, standardized incidence ratios, absolute risk differences
**Assessment time-points:** 6-12 months post-vaccination (primary), up to 5 years post-introduction (secondary)

## Data Extraction
**Method of data extraction:**
- Standardised data extraction forms developed based on Cochrane methodology
- Double data extraction with independent reviewers
- Arbitration by third reviewer for discrepancies

**Data items to be collected:**
- Study characteristics (design, location, timeframe)
- Population details (age, sex, comorbidities, socioeconomic status)
- Intervention details (PCV product, schedule, coverage achieved)
- Co-interventions (influenza vaccination, other vaccines)
- Outcome measures (numerators, denominators, effect estimates)
- Confounder adjustments
- Risk of bias assessments

## Risk of Bias Assessment
**Methods to be used:**
- Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs
- ROBINS-I tool for non-randomized studies
- Cluster RCTs: Additional consideration of recruitment bias and contamination
- GRADE framework for certainty of evidence assessment

**Methods to deal with missing data:**
- Contact study authors for missing data
- Imputation for missing patient-level data (if appropriate)
- Sensitivity analyses assuming missing data scenarios

## Synthesis of Results
**Methods to be used:**
1. **Pairwise Meta-analysis:**
   - Fixed-effect and random-effects models using inverse variance method
   - Risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes
   - Standardized mean differences (SMD) for continuous outcomes

2. **Network Meta-Analysis (NMA):**
   - Bayesian NMA using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods
   - gemtc package in R for analysis
   - Surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) for ranking interventions
   - Direct and indirect treatment comparisons

3. **Heterogeneity Assessment:**
   - Clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity evaluation
   - I² statistic and τ² for inconsistency
   - Prediction intervals for individual study effects

4. **Subgroup and Meta-regression Analyses:**
   - By income setting (LIC/MIC vs HIC)
   - By PCV product and schedule
   - Effect modifiers: HIV prevalence, malnutrition rates, antibiotic access

## Publication Bias Assessment
**Methods to be used:**
- Funnel plots for pairwise comparisons
- Egger's test for funnel plot asymmetry
- Trim-and-fill method for adjustment
- Comparison of registered vs published trials

## Confidence in Cumulative Evidence
**Methods to be used:**
- GRADE framework for each outcome and comparison
- Evidence profiles tabulating certainty ratings
- Summary of findings tables
