# Systematic Review Protocol: Childhood Pneumonia Prevention
## PCV Schedules and Influenza Vaccination Impact on Pneumonia and Mortality

## Research Question
What is the comparative effectiveness of different pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) schedules (PCV10/13/15/20) ± influenza vaccination on all-cause pneumonia and mortality in children under 5 years across varying resource settings?

## Primary Objectives
1. Compare the effectiveness of 2+1 vs 3+0 PCV schedules on radiologically confirmed pneumonia and all-cause LRTI admissions in children <5 years
2. Evaluate the additional impact of seasonal influenza vaccination on pneumonia prevention when combined with PCV
3. Assess the impact on all-cause mortality
4. Stratify analyses by income setting (LICs/MICs vs HICs)

## Secondary Objectives
- Evaluate serotype replacement patterns
- Assess impact of catch-up programs in various settings
- Examine role of effect modifiers (HIV exposure, malnutrition, antibiotic access)

## Population
- Children 0-59 months
- Settings: Low-income countries (LICs), Middle-income countries (MICs), High-income countries (HICs)
- Subgroups: HIV-exposed/unexposed, malnourished/well-nourished

## Interventions
- PCV10, PCV13, PCV15, PCV20 at different schedules (2+1, 3+0, 3+1, catch-up programs)
- Seasonal influenza vaccination in combination with PCV
- Placebo/no intervention controls

## Outcomes
### Primary Outcomes
- Radiologically confirmed pneumonia (within 6-12 months post-vaccination)
- All-cause lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) hospital admissions
- All-cause mortality

### Secondary Outcomes
- Clinical pneumonia episodes
- Serotype-specific pneumonia incidence
- Vaccine-serotype carriage/prevalence
- Antimicrobial resistance patterns

## Study Designs
- Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)
- Quasi-experimental studies
- Cluster randomized trials (including stepped wedge designs)
- Population-based cohort studies with strong design

## Data Sources
- PubMed (Medline)
- Cochrane CENTRAL
- WHO Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals (IVB) database
- Embase
- Web of Science
- Gavi/UNICEF reports and evaluations
- ClinicalTrials.gov for unpublished trials

## Search Strategy Framework
- Medical Subject Headings (MeSH): Pneumococcal Vaccines, Pneumonia, Child Mortality, Influenza Vaccines
- Keywords: PCV, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, pneumonia prevention, childhood mortality, vaccine schedules
- Date range: 2000 - current (PCV introduction period)
- Language: English

## Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
### Inclusion
- RCTs, quasi-experimental studies
- Populations primarily children <5 years
- Clear PCV schedule comparison (2+1 vs 3+0)
- Measurable pneumonia and/or mortality outcomes
- Minimum follow-up of 6 months post-vaccination

### Exclusion
- Studies without clinical outcomes data
- Editorials, letters, case reports
- Studies in high-risk populations only (e.g., hospitalized children)
- Non-comparative studies

## Risk of Bias Assessment
- Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RCTs)
- ROBINS-I (non-randomized studies)
- GRADE framework for certainty assessment

## Data Extraction
- Study characteristics (authors, year, location, setting)
- Population demographics (age, sex, comorbidities)
- Intervention details (PCV product, schedule, co-interventions)
- Outcome measures (incidence rates, relative risks, absolute differences)
- Adjustment variables and confounders

## Statistical Analysis Plan
- Network meta-analysis (NMA) for multi-arm comparisons of PCV products/schedules
- Random-effects models
- I² statistics for heterogeneity assessment
- Subgroup analyses by income setting
- Meta-regression for effect modifiers (HIV, malnutrition, antibiotic access)

## Heterogeneity Assessment
- Clinical heterogeneity: Setting, population characteristics, PCV product
- Methodological heterogeneity: Study design, outcome definitions
- Statistical heterogeneity: I² statistic, p-values

## Publication Bias Evaluation
- Funnel plots
- Egger's test
- Trim-and-fill method

## Project Timeline
- Month 1-2: Literature search and screening
- Month 3-4: Data extraction and risk of bias assessment
- Month 5-6: Statistical analysis and GRADE assessment
- Month 7: Manuscript writing and submission

## Ethical Considerations
- Use of publicly available data
- No direct patient contact or identifiable information
- Adherence to PRISMA-NMA guidelines
- Transparent reporting of funding sources
