## ABSTRACT

### Background
Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) have significantly reduced childhood pneumonia and mortality globally. However, optimal vaccine schedules and the potential additional benefit of influenza co-vaccination remain uncertain, particularly across varying resource settings.

### Methods
We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies comparing PCV schedules (2+1 vs 3+0) ± influenza vaccination on radiologically confirmed pneumonia, all-cause lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) admissions, and mortality in children <5 years. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis and network meta-analysis, stratifying by income settings. The protocol was prospectively registered (PROSPERO ID: pending).

### Results
We included 10 studies (6 RCTs/cluster RCTs, 4 quasi-experimental) from 8 countries, contributing 157,329 child-years of observation. PCV reduced radiologically confirmed pneumonia by 47% (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.42-0.67; I²=72.4%, p<0.001) and all-cause mortality by 32% (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.89). Effectiveness was greater in low-income countries (LIC) (pneumonia RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.36-0.61) than upper-middle-income countries (UMIC)/high-income countries (HIC) (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66-0.87). Direct comparisons showed no significant difference between 2+1 and 3+0 schedules (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.72-1.21).

### Conclusions
PCV significantly reduces childhood pneumonia and mortality, with greater impact in resource-limited settings. Current evidence supports continued PCV programs but suggests need for further research on optimal schedules in different settings.
