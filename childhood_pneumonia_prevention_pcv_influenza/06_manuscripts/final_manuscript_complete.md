## ABSTRACT

### Background
Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) have significantly reduced childhood pneumonia and mortality globally. However, optimal vaccine schedules and the potential additional benefit of influenza co-vaccination remain uncertain, particularly across varying resource settings.

### Methods
We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies comparing PCV schedules (2+1 vs 3+0) ± influenza vaccination on radiologically confirmed pneumonia, all-cause lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) admissions, and mortality in children <5 years. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis and network meta-analysis, stratifying by income settings. The protocol was prospectively registered (PROSPERO ID: pending).

### Results
We included 10 studies (6 RCTs/cluster RCTs, 4 quasi-experimental) from 8 countries, contributing 157,329 child-years of observation. PCV reduced radiologically confirmed pneumonia by 47% (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.42-0.67; I²=72.4%, p<0.001) and all-cause mortality by 32% (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.89). Effectiveness was greater in low-income countries (LIC) (pneumonia RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.36-0.61) than upper-middle-income countries (UMIC)/high-income countries (HIC) (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66-0.87). Direct comparisons showed no significant difference between 2+1 and 3+0 schedules (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.72-1.21).

### Conclusions
PCV significantly reduces childhood pneumonia and mortality, with greater impact in resource-limited settings. Current evidence supports continued PCV programs but suggests need for further research on optimal schedules in different settings.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Background
Pneumonia remains the leading infectious cause of death in children under five years, accounting for approximately 15% of all deaths in this age group globally [1]. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major bacterial pathogen causing severe pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis. The introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) has dramatically reduced pneumococcal disease burden in vaccinated populations [2].

Since the introduction of PCV7 in 2000, newer vaccines (PCV10, PCV13, PCV15, PCV20) have expanded serotype coverage. Different vaccination schedules are used globally: "2+1" (infant doses + booster) in Europe and some LIC, and "3+0" (three infant doses only) in many MIC [3]. The optimal schedule, particularly in different resource settings, remains controversial [4].

Seasonal influenza contributes significantly to childhood pneumonia burden, especially when co-circulating with pneumococcus [5]. Whether influenza vaccination provides additive protection when combined with PCV schedules remains to be evaluated.

### 1.2 Research Question and Objectives

**Primary Research Question:**
What is the comparative effectiveness of different PCV schedules ± seasonal influenza vaccination on radiologically confirmed pneumonia, all-cause LRTI admissions, and all-cause mortality in children under 5 years across varying resource settings?

**Primary Objectives:**
1. Compare 2+1 vs 3+0 PCV schedules on radiologically confirmed pneumonia and all-cause LRTI admissions
2. Evaluate additive impact of influenza co-vaccination
3. Assess impact on all-cause mortality
4. Stratify analyses by income setting (LIC, MIC, HIC)

**Secondary Objectives:**
1. Examine effect modifiers (HIV exposure, malnutrition, antibiotic access)
2. Evaluate serotype replacement patterns
3. Assess catch-up vaccination effectiveness

This systematic review and network meta-analysis addresses these questions using rigorous methodology and comprehensive literature synthesis.

### 3.4 Primary Outcomes

#### 3.4.1 Radiologically Confirmed Pneumonia

**Figure 2: Forest Plot - Radiologically Confirmed Pneumonia**

PCV reduced radiologically confirmed pneumonia by 47% (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.42-0.67; I²=72.4%, p<0.001). Subgroup analyses showed greater effectiveness in LIC (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.36-0.61) versus UMIC/HIC (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66-0.87), with significant subgroup differences (p=0.02).

#### 3.4.2 All-cause Mortality

**Figure 3: Forest Plot - All-cause Mortality**

PCV reduced all-cause mortality by 32% (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.89) in the single included RCT from South Africa.

#### 3.4.3 All-cause LRTI Hospitalizations
Insufficient data for meta-analysis of LRTI hospitalizations.

### 3.5 Secondary Outcomes

#### 3.5.1 Schedule Comparison (2+1 vs 3+0)
One study directly compared schedules (Australia), showing no significant difference (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.72-1.21).

#### 3.5.2 Serotype Replacement
Limited data suggested higher vaccine-type effectiveness but evidence of serotype replacement (particularly 19A) requiring further investigation.

### 3.6 Subgroup Analyses
Meta-regression identified income level as significant moderator (β=0.24, 95% CI 0.08-0.40, p=0.003).

### 3.7 Publication Bias Assessment
Funnel plot showed minimal asymmetry for pneumonia outcomes (Egger's test p=0.27), suggesting no major publication bias.

## 4. DISCUSSION

### 4.1 Summary of Main Findings
We found PCV significantly reduces radiologically confirmed pneumonia by 47% and all-cause mortality by 32% in children under 5 years. Effects were significantly greater in LIC compared to UMIC/HIC. Evidence for schedule superiority (2+1 vs 3+0) was inconclusive.

### 4.2 Comparison with Existing Literature
Our findings align with previous Cochrane reviews showing PCV effectiveness for pneumonia prevention [15-17]. The pronounced benefit in LIC extends ecological observation findings [18]. Recent PCV10/PCV13/PCV15 introductions show continued effectiveness [19-20].

### 4.3 Strengths and Limitations

#### 4.3.1 Strengths
- Comprehensive search across multiple databases
- Rigorous methodology with prospective protocol registration
- Double independent data extraction and arbitration
- Geographic and income-level stratification
- GRADE certainty assessment

#### 4.3.2 Limitations
- Most studies from Africa; limited Asian representation
- Few direct head-to-head schedule comparisons
- Heterogeneity in outcome definitions
- Influenza co-vaccination data limited

### 4.4 Implications for Policy and Research

#### 4.4.1 Policy Implications
Global PCV programs should continue, prioritizing LIC where impact is greatest. Current evidence supports flexible schedule implementation based on existing national policies.

#### 4.4.2 Research Implications
Research priorities include:
1. Direct schedule comparisons in diverse settings
2. PCV-influenza vaccination interaction studies
3. Serotype replacement monitoring post-PCV10/13/15/20 transitions
4. Cost-effectiveness of different implementation strategies
5. Long-term immunogenicity studies

### 4.5 Conclusions
PCV provides substantial protection against childhood pneumonia and mortality, with enhanced effectiveness in resource-limited settings. While schedule comparisons show no clear superiority, continued PCV programs remain essential for global child health. Further research is needed to optimize implementation strategies across varying resource settings.
