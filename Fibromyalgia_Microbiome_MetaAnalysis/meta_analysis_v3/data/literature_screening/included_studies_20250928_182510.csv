40452048,Characterisation of the Oral Microbiome in Women With Fibromyalgia: An Observational Case-Control Study.,"Fibromyalgia is a complex disorder, associated with a range of symptoms, not least of which is chronic, widespread pain. Although several reports have brought the role of oral health in systemic diseases into recent focus, the oral microbiome in fibromyalgia is unexplored. The aim of this study was to compare oral health and the oral microbiome in women with fibromyalgia with that of age-matched controls.","Erdrich, Jayasinghe, Vuyisich et al.","European journal of pain (London, England)",2025,10.1002/ejp.70051,"Fibromyalgia, Microbiome, Diversity",True,Meets inclusion criteria,,False,No quantitative diversity data,,False,Insufficient sample size or methods,,False,Study does not meet eligibility criteria
39456224,Human Herpesvirus-6B Infection and Alterations of Gut Microbiome in Patients with Fibromyalgia: A Pilot Study.,"Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain often accompanied by fatigue, sleep disturbances, memory issues, and mood disorders. The exact cause of FM remains unknown, and diagnosis is typically based on a history of persistent widespread pain, as there are no objective biomarkers usable in diagnosis of this disorder available. The aim of this study was to identify measurable indicators specific to FM with potential as biomarkers. This study included 17 individuals diagnosed with FM and 24 apparently healthy persons. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), we detected the presence of human herpesvirus (HHV)-6A and B genomic sequences in DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and buccal swabs. HHV-6-specific IgG and IgM class antibodies, along with proinflammatory cytokine levels, were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and bead-based multiplex assays. Additionally, the gut microbiome was analyzed through next-generation sequencing. HHV-6B was more frequently detected in the PBMCs of FM patients. FM patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher exhibited elevated cytokine levels compared to the control group with the same BMI range. Gut microbiome analysis revealed significant differences in both α-diversity and β-diversity between the FM and control groups, indicating a shift in species abundance in the FM group.","Ievina, Fomins, Gudra et al.",Biomolecules,2024,10.3390/biom14101291,"Fibromyalgia, Microbiome, Diversity",True,Meets inclusion criteria,,True,Contains diversity measures in FM cohort,,True,Suitable methods and outcomes,,True,
37866648,Associations Between Brain-Gut Axis and Psychological Distress in Fibromyalgia: A Microbiota and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study.,"An altered brain-gut axis is suspected to be one of the pathomechanisms in fibromyalgia (FM). This cross-sectional study investigated the associations among altered microbiota, psychological distress, and brain functional connectivity (FC) in FM. We recruited 25 FM patients and 25 healthy people in the present study. Psychological distress was measured using standardized questionnaires. Microbiota analysis was performed on the participants' stools. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired, and seed-based resting-state FC (rs-FC) analysis was conducted with the salience network nodes as seeds. Linear regression and mediation analyses evaluated microbiota, symptoms, and rs-FCs associations. We found altered microbiota diversity in FM, of which Phascolarctobacterium and Lachnoclostridium taxa increased the most and Faecalibacterium taxon decreased the most compared to controls. The Phascolarctobacterium abundance significantly predicted Beck depression inventory (BDI-II) scores in FM (β = 6.83; P = .033). Rs-FCs from salience network nodes were reduced in FM, of which rs-FCs from the right lateral rostral prefrontal cortex (RPFC) to the lateral occipital cortex, superior division right (RPFC-sLOC) could be predicted by BDI-II scores in patients (β = -.0064; P = .0054). In addition, the BDI-II score was a mediator in the association between Phascolarctobacterium abundance and rs-FCs of RPFC-sLOC (ab = -.06; 95% CI: -.16 to -9.10","Nhu, Chen, Yang et al.",The journal of pain,2024,10.1016/j.jpain.2023.10.015,"Fibromyalgia, Microbiome, Diversity",True,Meets inclusion criteria,,True,Contains diversity measures in FM cohort,,True,Suitable methods and outcomes,,True,

36149895,Fibromyalgia-associated hyperalgesia is related to psychopathological alterations but not to gut microbiome changes.,"Fibromyalgia-syndrome (FMS) is a complex disease characterized by chronic widespread pain and additional symptoms including depression, cognitive dysfunction (""fibro-fog"") and maldigestion. Our research team examined whether FMS-related pain parameters assessed by quantitative sensory testing (QST) and psychological disturbances are accompanied by alterations of the fecal microbiome. We recruited 25 patients with FMS and 26 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Medical background, food habits, psychopathology and quality of life were assessed through questionnaires. Stool samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. QST was performed according to the protocol of the German Network for Neuropathic Pain. QST showed that both lemniscal and spinothalamic afferent pathways are altered in FMS patients relative to healthy controls and that peripheral as well as central pain sensitization processes are manifest. Psychometric assessment revealed enhanced scores of depression, anxiety and stress. In contrast, neither the composition nor the alpha- and beta-diversity of the fecal microbiome was changed in FMS patients. FMS patients segregate from healthy controls in various parameters of QST and psychopathology, but not in terms of composition and diversity of the fecal microbiome. Despite consideration of several confounding factors, we conclude that the contribution of the gut microbiome to the pathophysiology of FMS is limited.","Weber, Tatzl, Kashofer et al.",PloS one,2022,10.1371/journal.pone.0274026,"Fibromyalgia, Microbiome, Diversity",True,Meets inclusion criteria,,True,Contains diversity measures in FM cohort,,True,Suitable methods and outcomes,,True,
36011823,Detection of Intestinal Dysbiosis in Post-COVID-19 Patients One to Eight Months after Acute Disease Resolution.,"The intestinal microbiota plays an important role in the immune response against viral infections, modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses. The cytokine storm is associated with COVID-19 severity, and the patient's immune status is influenced by the intestinal microbiota in a gut-lung bidirectional interaction. In this study, we evaluate the intestinal microbiota of Brazilian patients in different post-COVID-19 periods, and correlate this with clinical data and the antibiotic therapy used during the acute phase. DNA extracted from stool samples was sequenced and total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and C-reactive protein were quantified. Compared with controls, there were significant differences in the microbiota diversity in post-COVID-19 patients, suggesting an intestinal dysbiosis even several months after acute disease resolution. Additionally, we detected some genera possibly associated with the post-COVID-19 dysbiosis, including","Ferreira-Junior, Borgonovi, De Salis et al.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022,10.3390/ijerph191610189,"Fibromyalgia, Microbiome, Diversity",True,Meets inclusion criteria,,True,Contains diversity measures in FM cohort,,False,Insufficient sample size or methods,,False,Study does not meet eligibility criteria
35664958,"Effect of ancient Khorasan wheat on gut microbiota, inflammation, and short-chain fatty acid production in patients with fibromyalgia.","Fibromyalgia (FM) syndrome is mainly characterized by widespread pain, sleeping disorders, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction. In many cases, gastrointestinal distress is also reported, suggesting the potential pathogenic role of the gut microbiota (GM). The GM is deeply influenced by several environmental factors, especially the diet, and recent findings highlighted significant symptom improvement in FM patients following various nutritional interventions such as vegetarian diet, low-fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols based diets, gluten-free diet, and especially an ancient grain supplementation. In particular, a recent study reported that a replacement diet with ancient Khorasan wheat led to an overall improvement in symptom severity of FM patients.","Baldi, Pagliai, Dinu et al.",World journal of gastroenterology,2022,10.3748/wjg.v28.i18.1965,"Fibromyalgia, Microbiome, Diversity",True,Meets inclusion criteria,,True,Contains diversity measures in FM cohort,,True,Suitable methods and outcomes,,True,
35587528,Altered serum bile acid profile in fibromyalgia is associated with specific gut microbiome changes and symptom severity.,"Alterations in the composition and function of the gut microbiome in women with fibromyalgia have recently been demonstrated, including changes in the relative abundance of certain bile acid-metabolizing bacteria. Bile acids can affect multiple physiological processes, including visceral pain, but have yet to be explored for association to the fibromyalgia gut microbiome. In this study, 16S rRNA sequencing and targeted metabolomic approaches were used to characterize the gut microbiome and circulating bile acids in a cohort of 42 women with fibromyalgia and 42 healthy controls. Alterations in the relative abundance of several bacterial species known to metabolize bile acids were observed in women with fibromyalgia, accompanied by significant alterations in the serum concentration of secondary bile acids, including a marked depletion of α-muricholic acid. Statistical learning algorithms could accurately detect individuals with fibromyalgia using the concentration of these serum bile acids. Serum α-muricholic acid was highly correlated with symptom severity, including pain intensity and fatigue. Taken together, these findings suggest serum bile acid alterations are implicated in nociplastic pain. The changes observed in the composition of the gut microbiota and the concentration of circulating secondary bile acids seem congruent with the phenotype of increased nociception and are quantitatively correlated with symptom severity. This is a first demonstration of circulating bile acid alteration in individuals with fibromyalgia, potentially secondary to upstream gut microbiome alterations. If corroborated in independent studies, these observations may allow for the development of molecular diagnostic aids for fibromyalgia as well as mechanistic insights into the syndrome.","Minerbi, Gonzalez, Brereton et al.",Pain,2023,10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002694,"Fibromyalgia, Microbiome, Diversity",True,Meets inclusion criteria,,True,Contains diversity measures in FM cohort,,True,Suitable methods and outcomes,,True,
34382150,Linking the gut microbiota to persistent symptoms in survivors of COVID-19 after discharge.,"Several follow-up studies have found that COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) patients had persistent symptoms after discharge. Gut microbiota play an important role in human health and immune responses. Therefore, this study investigated the gut microbiota of recovered COVID-19 patients and the correlations between gut microbiota and persistent symptoms after discharge. Stool samples were collected from 15 recovered healthcare workers (HCWs) with COVID-19 at three months after discharge, in addition, stool samples were collected from 14 healthy controls (HCs) to perform 16S rRNA gene sequencing between May and July 2020. Compared with HCs, recovered HCWs had reduced bacterial diversity at three months after discharge, with a significantly higher relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens, and a significantly lower relative abundance of beneficial bacteria. In addition, Escherichia unclassified was positively correlated with persistent symptoms at three months after discharge, including fatigue (r = 0.567, p = 0.028), chest tightness after activity (r = 0.687, p = 0.005), and myalgia (r = 0.523, p = 0.045). Intestinibacter bartlettii was positively correlated with anorexia (r = 0.629, p = 0.012) and fatigue (r = 0.545, p = 0.036). However, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was negatively correlated with chest tightness after activity (r = -0.591, p = 0.02), and Intestinimonas butyriciproducens was negatively correlated with cough (r = -0.635, p = 0.011). In conclusion, the gut microbiota of recovered HCWs with COVID-19 at three months after discharge was different from that of HCs, and altered gut microbiota was correlated with persistent symptoms after discharge, highlighting that gut microbiota may play an important role in the recovery of patients with COVID-19.","Zhou, Zhang, Zhang et al.","Journal of microbiology (Seoul, Korea)",2021,10.1007/s12275-021-1206-5,"Fibromyalgia, Microbiome, Diversity",False,Does not mention microbiome diversity in FM patients,,False,No quantitative diversity data,,False,Insufficient sample size or methods,,False,Study does not meet eligibility criteria
33882648,[Investigating of Relation Between Fibromyalgia Syndrome and Intestinal Microbiota].,"Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is one of the most frequent forms of chronic widespread pain, with a reported prevalence of 3-10% in the adult population. Clinical presentation of the typical pain and the presence of associated somatic and psychological symptoms form the basis of the diagnosis. FMS is associated with nervous system dysfunction and neurotransmitters act as targets of a number of drugs approved for fibromyalgia. However, although the underlying mechanisms in FMS are not yet known precisely, many hypotheses have been put forward. Considering the relation between fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), altered gut microbiome could be associated with fibromyalgia. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the variation of intestinal microbiome levels in patients with FMS compared to healthy controls. For the investigation of the microbiome, fecal samples were collected from a cohort of 54 patients with FMS and 36 healthy individuals. Those with any mental and/or physical illness in the control group were excluded from the study. The FMS patient group was determined according to the ""American College of Rheumatology (ACR)"" 2010 diagnostic criteria. The fecal samples were stored at -80°C until use and were thawed on ice; for each extraction, 0.3 g of faeces were weighed. Extraction of DNA was carried out with commercial kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Samples were compared using 16S rRNA gene amplification with specific primers of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Enterobacter, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Bifidobacterium by the real-time PCR method. According to our results, while the increase of Bacteroidetes and Bifidobacterium was statistically significant (p<0.05), Firmicutes decreased (p<0.001) in the patient group. No statistically significant results were found for Enterobacter, Streptococcus and Lactobacillus (p> 0.05). When the relationship between bacteria was evaluated, a high statistically significance and negative correlation was found between Bacteroidetes and the percentage of Firmicutes (r= -0.778, p<0.001),while a moderate statistical significance and positive correlation was observed between the percentage of Enterobacter and Bifidobacterium (r= 0.460, p= 0.005). The results suggest that the gut microbiota may play a role in fibromyalgia. The balance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla in the gut is known to have important effects on intestinal homeostasis. In summary, it is clear that large-scale further research in larger cohorts will be effective in understanding the relationship between the gut microbiome and FMS and evaluating possible treatment options.","Albayrak, Süsgün, Küçükakkaş et al.",Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,2021,10.5578/mb.20219903,"Fibromyalgia, Microbiome, Diversity",True,Meets inclusion criteria,,True,Contains diversity measures in FM cohort,,True,Suitable methods and outcomes,,True,

To gain an insight into the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia and identify diagnostic biomarkers, we combined different omics techniques to analyse microbiome and serum composition.","Clos-Garcia, Andrés-Marin, Fernández-Eulate et al.",EBioMedicine,2019,10.1016/j.ebiom.2019.07.031,"Fibromyalgia, Microbiome, Diversity",False,Does not mention microbiome diversity in FM patients,,False,No quantitative diversity data,,False,Insufficient sample size or methods,,False,Study does not meet eligibility criteria
31219947,Altered microbiome composition in individuals with fibromyalgia.,"Fibromyalgia (FM) is a prevalent syndrome, characterised by chronic widespread pain, fatigue, and impaired sleep, that is challenging to diagnose and difficult to treat. The microbiomes of 77 women with FM and that of 79 control participants were compared using 16S rRNA gene amplification and whole-genome sequencing. When comparing FM patients with unrelated controls using differential abundance analysis, significant differences were revealed in several bacterial taxa. Variance in the composition of the microbiomes was explained by FM-related variables more than by any other innate or environmental variable and correlated with clinical indices of FM. In line with observed alteration in butyrate-metabolising species, targeted serum metabolite analysis verified differences in the serum levels of butyrate and propionate in FM patients. Using machine-learning algorithms, the microbiome composition alone allowed for the classification of patients and controls (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve 87.8%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of gut microbiome alteration in nonvisceral pain. This observation paves the way for further studies, elucidating the pathophysiology of FM, developing diagnostic aids and possibly allowing for new treatment modalities to be explored.","Minerbi, Gonzalez, Brereton et al.",Pain,2019,10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001640,"Fibromyalgia, Microbiome, Diversity",False,Does not mention microbiome diversity in FM patients,,False,No quantitative diversity data,,False,Insufficient sample size or methods,,False,Study does not meet eligibility criteria
