## Title
Associations Between Microbiome Diversity and Fibromyalgia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

## Authors
[Research Team]

## Background
Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic pain condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive symptoms. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiome alterations may play a role in fibromyalgia pathogenesis, potentially through the gut-brain axis.

Despite growing interest in the microbiome-fibromyalgia relationship, there remains uncertainty about associations between microbiome diversity and fibromyalgia symptoms due to inconsistent findings across studies.

This systematic review aims to comprehensively synthesize the evidence on associations between microbiome diversity measures (e.g., alpha diversity, beta diversity) and fibromyalgia.

## Objectives
### Primary Objectives
1. To systematically review studies investigating associations between microbiome diversity and fibromyalgia
2. To perform meta-analysis to quantify the magnitude of associations where appropriate
3. To evaluate the quality and risk of bias of included studies
4. To identify gaps in current research and suggest future directions

### Secondary Objectives
1. To explore potential moderators of microbiome diversity-fibromyalgia associations (e.g., study design, microbiome assessment methods, patient demographics)

## Research Questions
1. What is the association between measures of microbiome diversity (alpha diversity, beta diversity) and fibromyalgia?
2. To what extent do associations vary by:
   - Microbiome assessment method (16S rRNA sequencing vs. shotgun metagenomics)
   - Diversity metric (Shannon index, Simpson index, observed species, etc.)
   - Body site sampled (feces, saliva, blood)
   - Study design (case-control, cohort, cross-sectional)

## Methods

### Study Design
Systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines.

### Eligibility Criteria

#### Inclusion Criteria
- **Population**: Human participants with fibromyalgia diagnosed according to established criteria (ACR 1990/2010/2016, ICD codes)
- **Exposure/Intervention**: Any measure of microbiome diversity (alpha diversity: Shannon, Simpson, Chao1, observed species richness; beta diversity: Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, Unifrac distances)
- **Comparator**: Healthy controls or fibromyalgia patients without specific microbiome interventions
- **Outcome**: Associations between microbiome diversity measures and fibromyalgia diagnosis, symptoms, or severity
- **Study Design**: Observational studies (case-control, cohort, cross-sectional), clinical trials
- **Language**: English
- **Publication Status**: Peer-reviewed journal articles

#### Exclusion Criteria
- **Population**: Animal studies, studies of other pain conditions without fibromyalgia
- **Exposure**: Microbiome composition without diversity measures
- **Study Design**: Reviews, case reports, letters, conference abstracts without full data
- **Incomplete Data**: Studies without sufficient statistical data for meta-analysis

### Search Strategy

#### Electronic Databases
1. PubMed/MEDLINE
2. Cochrane Library
3. Embase (via Ovid)
4. Scopus
5. Web of Science

#### Search Terms
The search strategy will combine terms for:
- Fibromyalgia: "fibromyalgia", "fibrositis", "FM"
- Microbiome: "microbiome", "microbiota", "gut microbiome", "intestinal flora"
- Diversity: "diversity", "alpha diversity", "beta diversity", "Shannon index", "Simpson index", "Chao1", "observed species"

#### Date Restrictions
All years up to current date (no lower date limit to capture complete literature)

#### Additional Search Methods
1. Grey literature search (Google Scholar, OpenGrey) for the first 200 results
2. Hand-searching reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews
3. Forward citation searching using Scopus and Web of Science

### Study Selection Process
1. **Title/Abstract Screening**: Two reviewers independently screen titles and abstracts using predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria
2. **Full-text Screening**: Two reviewers independently assess full texts of potentially eligible studies
3. **Disagreements**: Resolved by discussion with a third reviewer

### Data Extraction
Data extraction will be performed independently by two reviewers using a standardized form including:
- **Study Characteristics**: Author, year, country, study design, sample size
- **Population Details**: Age, gender, fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria, disease duration, medication use
- **Methods**: Body site sampled, sequencing platform, bioinformatics pipeline
- **Microbiome Diversity Measures**: Alpha diversity indices (Shannon, Simpson, Chao1, observed species), beta diversity metrics
- **Outcomes**: Effect sizes (mean differences, standardized mean differences, correlation coefficients, odds ratios)
- **Risk of Bias Assessment**

### Risk of Bias Assessment
Risk of bias will be assessed using appropriate tools based on study design:

#### For Observational Studies
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) with focus on:
- Selection bias (case definition, representativeness, selection of controls)
- Comparability (control for confounders)
- Outcome/exposure assessment (ascertainment of exposure/outcome, blinding)

#### For Clinical Trials
Cochrane Risk of Bias tool with domains:
- Random sequence generation
- Allocation concealment
- Blinding (participants, personnel, outcome assessors)
- Incomplete outcome data
- Selective outcome reporting
- Other bias

### Data Synthesis
#### Narrative Synthesis
Descriptive synthesis of study characteristics, methods, and findings.

#### Quantitative Synthesis (Meta-Analysis)
Where sufficient homogeneous data exist, random-effects meta-analysis will be performed:
- **Alpha Diversity Measures**: Standardized mean differences (SMD) comparing fibromyalgia vs. controls
- **Correlation Analyses**: Correlation coefficients between diversity measures and symptom severity
- **Subgroup Analyses**: By diversity metric, body site, sequencing method
- **Sensitivity Analyses**: By study quality, excluding high-risk bias studies

#### Heterogeneity Assessment
- I² statistic (low: <25%, moderate: 25-75%, high: >75%)
- Cochran Q test (p < 0.10 indicating heterogeneity)
- Subgroup analyses for potential sources of heterogeneity

#### Publication Bias
- Funnel plots for meta-analyses with ≥10 studies
- Egger's test for asymmetry
- Trim-and-fill analysis if publication bias detected

### Quality Assessment of Evidence
Overall quality of evidence assessed using GRADE framework considering:
- Study limitations (risk of bias)
- Consistency of results
- Directness of evidence
- Precision of estimates
- Publication bias

### Statistical Software
- Meta-analysis: R package 'metafor' or 'meta'
- Forest plots: R package 'ggplot2' or 'forestplot'
- Risk of bias visualization: R package 'robvis'
