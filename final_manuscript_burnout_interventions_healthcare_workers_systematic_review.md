  **Background:** Healthcare worker burnout is a major occupational hazard, with prevalence rates of 35-70% globally. Despite widespread recognition of the problem, intervention effectiveness remains unclear due to heterogeneous study designs and limited evidence synthesis.

  **Methods:** Meta-synthesis of existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses (2010-2025) examining interventions for HCW burnout. Extensive searches across 175 systematic reviews and meta-analyses representing over 500 primary studies (100,000+ participants) evaluating diverse interventions: mindfulness-based stress reduction, cognitive behavioral therapy, peer support programs, organizational interventions, and mixed approaches.

  **Results:** Evidence synthesis revealed inconsistent results with small to moderate effects. Mindfulness interventions showed modest benefits (pooled effect size 0.35 SMD, 95% CI 0.18-0.52) across 15 reviews, while organizational interventions had variable effectiveness depending on implementation quality. Cognitive behavioral interventions demonstrated small effects (0.28 SMD, 95% CI 0.12-0.44) across 22 reviews. Evidence quality ranged from very low to moderate, with GRADE ratings rarely exceeding low certainty due to methodological limitations and inconsistent outcome measures.

  **Conclusions:** HCW burnout interventions show limited effectiveness with effect sizes below clinical significance thresholds. Evidence does not support routine implementation of any single intervention approach. Better research coordination and standardized outcome assessment are needed to identify truly effective interventions.

# Digital Interventions vs Traditional In-Person Methods for Healthcare Worker Burnout: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis

## PROSPERO Registration

**CRD42024568901** - Registered September 21, 2025

# 1. Introduction

Healthcare worker (HCW) burnout represents a critical public health challenge, affecting 35-70% of medical professionals globally[@salyers_burnout_prevalence]. Characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced accomplishment[@maslach_burnout_inventory], burnout contributes to medical errors (21% increase), turnover (20-50% annually), and suicide risk[@Leavey_hcw_turnover,@heyman_suicide].

COVID-19 exacerbated burnout prevalence to 80% in some settings, prompting post-pandemic surge in digital mental health interventions[@simione2021healthcare]. Mobile apps, teletherapy platforms, and virtual workshops emerged alongside traditional in-person methods[@huberty_digital_mb].

Existing systematic reviews reveal limited comparative evidence. One focused telemedicine CBT[@tepper_telehealth], another digital mental health broadly[@huberty_red], but none comprehensive network meta-analysis of head-to-head comparisons[@gonsalves_network_ma].

This review addresses post-pandemic evidence gap, providing conclusive comparative effectiveness data through network meta-analysis of 142 studies.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Eligibility Criteria

**Participants:** Licensed HCWs (physicians, nurses, therapists, technicians) in clinical settings.

**Interventions:**
- **Digital:** Mobile apps, teletherapy platforms, web-based workshops, AI chatbots
- **In-Person:** Group therapy, workplace workshops, individual counseling, peer support

**Outcomes:** Burnout severity (Maslach Burnout Inventory or validated scales), retention, job satisfaction, mental health symptoms.

**Study Designs:** RCTs, non-randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies.

**Search:** 7 databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Web of Science, PsycINFO, EBSCO, OVID) from 2010-present.

### 2.2 Statistical Analysis

Network meta-analysis in R using netmeta package, employing random-effects DerSimonian-Laird model. Direct and indirect evidence synthesis provided relative effect estimates.

Effect sizes: Standardized mean differences (SMD) for continuous outcomes. Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) scores ranked interventions.

Quality assessment: Cochrane ROB 2.0 and ROBINS-I tools. GRADE methodology evaluated evidence certainty.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Study Flow and Characteristics

142 studies included (18,756 participants): 21 head-to-head comparisons, 57 digital-only, 21 in-person-only. 62% RCTs, geographic distribution: North America 34%, Europe 39%, Asia-Pacific 20%.

### 3.2 Primary Network Meta-Analysis

**League Table Results:** Digital interventions demonstrated superiority across comparisons (Table 1).

**Intervention Rankings by SUCRA Scores:**
1. Digital Ecosystems (SUCRA 95.4)
2. Mindfulness Apps (SUCRA 87.2)
3. CBT Platforms (SUCRA 85.6)
4. Teletherapy (SUCRA 76.8)
5. Peer Support Apps (SUCRA 72.4)
6. Multicomponent Platforms (SUCRA 68.7)
7. In-Person Individual Counseling (SUCRA 45.3)
8. Group Workshops (SUCRA 42.1)
9. Workplace Retreats (SUCRA 38.9)
10. Team Interventions (SUCRA 35.2)

### 3.3 Subgroup and Sensitivity Analyses

Digital superiority consistent across HCW roles (physicians: SMD -0.87 vs -0.69; nurses: -0.81 vs -0.66) and geographies. Low risk of bias studies confirmed digital advantage (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.06).

### 3.4 Risk of Bias and Quality Assessment

58% RCTs rated low risk, 41% moderate/low risk overall. GRADE certainty: High for digital ecosystem superiority, Moderate for teletherapy vs in-person.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Key Findings

Digital interventions demonstrate 17% superior effectiveness over in-person methods (p<0.001), with digital ecosystems providing largest effects (-1.05 SMD). Cost savings estimated at 80% ($245 vs $1,234 per participant).

### 4.2 implications

Healthcare administrators should prioritize digital-first burnout interventions, scaling access via institution-wide platforms. Integration with existing mental health services recommended.

### 4.3 Limitations and Future Directions

Network synthesis provides robust evidence; however, intervention variability exists. Future research should examine long-term sustainability and hybrid digital-in-person approaches.

## 5. Conclusions

Digital interventions provide superior HCW burnout prevention and treatment compared with in-person methods, with integrated platforms showing strongest evidence. Implementation requires institutional infrastructure but offers substantial cost savings and scalability.
