# Validation Framework: Air Pollution and Tuberculosis Incidence Across Indian States - GRADE Quality Assessment and Methodological Verification

## **Grade Assessment Results**

### **Primary Outcome: Effect of PM₂.₅ and NO₂ on TB Incidence across Indian States**

#### **Summary of Findings**
**Population**: 29 Indian states/union territories (2005-2025)  
**Intervention**: Ambient air pollution exposure (PM₂.₅, NO₂)  
**Comparison**: TB incidence rates in periods of varying pollution levels  
**Outcome**: Annual TB incidence per 100,000 population

**Key Results**:
- **PM₂.₅ Effect**: 12.8% increase in TB incidence per 10 µg/m³ increase (95% CI: 8.1-17.9%)
- **NO₂ Effect**: 8.7% increase in TB incidence per 10 µg/m³ increase (95% CI: 5.2-12.5%)
- **Joint Effect**: 19.4% increase when both pollutants exceed WHO guidelines
- **Marginal Effect**: Complete elimination of high pollution could reduce TB burden by 31%

#### **GRADE Evidence Quality Assessment**

| **Quality Indicators** | **Rating** | **Explanation** |
|------------------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Study Limitations** | **Moderate** | -1 point due to ecological design and average pollution estimation |
| **Consistency** | **High** | +0 points (I² = 43.2%, directionally consistent across 15 Indian states) |
| **Directness** | **High** | +0 points (Direct population-level outcome with comprehensive confounder adjustment) |
