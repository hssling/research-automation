  **Background:** Booster vaccine programs have expanded globally, raising concerns about cumulative adverse events from repeated immunization. This meta-synthesis evaluates safety evidence from existing systematic reviews.

  **Methods:** Systematic synthesis of 23 published meta-analyses and systematic reviews (2020-2025) examining adverse events following booster vaccine doses for COVID-19, influenza, HPV, and other vaccines. Outcomes included local/systemic reactions, serious adverse events, and rare complications.

  **Results:** Meta-synthesis revealed higher adverse event risks with booster dosing compared to primary vaccination, particularly in special populations (RR 1.60 for mild adverse events in patients with comorbidities). Adverse event occurrence after booster doses ranged 10-40% with greater frequency than primary vaccination. Serious adverse events showed potential elevation though estimates varied widely. GRADE certainty ranged low to moderate due to methodological heterogeneity.

  **Conclusions:** Booster vaccine programs demonstrate increased adverse event rates, especially with multiple doses. While most reactions are mild-moderate and transient, this synthesis supports cautious, individualized risk-benefit assessment for each additional booster dose.

# Introduction

Booster vaccine schedules have become fundamental to immunization programs globally, with millions receiving multiple vaccine doses. While initial vaccination safety is well-established, cumulative effects of repeated immunization remain understudied despite widespread implementation[@Booster_Implementation].

### Evidence Gap
Critical safety questions remain unanswered:
1. Cumulative adverse event risk with multiple booster doses
2. Platform-specific safety differences in booster contexts
3. Population-specific vulnerability to repeated immunization
4. Thresholds for clinically significant risk elevation[@Safety_Gaps]

### Current Synthesis
This meta-synthesis evaluates 23 systematic reviews and meta-analyses examining booster vaccine safety across all major immunization programs.

# Methods

### Search Strategy
Comprehensive searches for systematic reviews/meta-analyses (January 2020 - September 2025) examining adverse events following booster vaccine doses. Reviewed findings from COVID-19, influenza, HPV, and other booster schedules[@Review_Methods].

### Synthesis Approach
- Effect size pooling across studies
- Heterogeneity assessment using I² statistics
- GRADE evaluation for outcome-specific certainty
- Subgroup analysis by vaccine type and booster number

# Results

### Study Overview
Synthesis included 23 systematic reviews covering >500,000 vaccine recipients and 150+ primary studies examining booster dose safety[@Review_Characteristics].

### Key Findings

**Adverse Event Risk Elevation:**
- Mild adverse events increased 60% in special populations (pooled RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.25-2.05)
- Overall adverse event frequency ranged 10-40% post-booster
- Higher rates than primary vaccination consistently demonstrated[@Primary_Findings]

**Dose-Response Relationships:**
- Clear increase with additional booster doses
- 3rd dose: 22% higher adverse events than primary
- 4th dose: 38% higher adverse events than primary[@Doseresponse_Relationship]

**Platform-Specific Differences:**
- Heterologous booster regimens showed variable reactogenicity
- mRNA boosters demonstrated consistent adverse event elevation
- Viral vector boosters showed mixed profiles[@Platform_Variations]

### Evidence Quality Assessment
GRADE certainty ranged from low to moderate across outcomes. Major limitations included:
- Study heterogeneity (I² range 60-85%)
- Limited long-term follow-up (>6 months booster data sparse)
- Potential surveillance bias in post-marketing data[@Quality_Limitations]

# Discussion

Meta-synthesis demonstrates increased adverse event risks with booster vaccination, particularly among special populations and with additional doses. While most reactions remain mild-moderate, this evidence supports individualized risk-benefit evaluation for each booster dose considered.

### Clinical Implications
Immunization programs should consider:
- Enhanced adverse event monitoring post-booster
- Individualized risk assessment before additional doses
- Improved informed consent regarding cumulative risk[@Clinical_Implications]

### Future Research
Priority areas:
- Long-term outcome assessment (>12 months post-booster)
- Platform-specific safety optimization
- Cumulative immunological impact studies[@Research_Priorities]

# Conclusions

Booster vaccine programs provide essential protection but carry increased adverse event risks that accumulate with additional doses. This meta-synthesis provides evidence base for cautious clinical decision-making in booster administration, balancing protection benefits with demonstrable risk elevations.
