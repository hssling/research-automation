## Registration Details
**Systematic Review Title:** Plant-Based Diets and Mental Health Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

### 3. Objective
To provide a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between plant-based diets and mental health outcomes, addressing controversies in nutrition-psychiatry literature and informing dietary recommendations for mental health prevention.

### 4. Selection Criteria and Eligibility

#### 4.1 Types of study to be included
- **Design:** RCTs, prospective/retrospective cohorts, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies
- **Participants:** Adults ≥18 years
- **Context:** Population-based or clinical settings

#### 4.2 Condition or domain being studied
- Diet-mental health relationships
- Nutrition-psychiatry associations

#### 4.3 Intervention(s), exposure(s)
- Plant-based dietary patterns:
  - Vegetarian (lacto-ovo, lacto, ovo, vegan)
  - Plant-predominant diets (≥70% plant foods)
  - Dietary patterns high in fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains
- Exposure assessment: Dietary questionnaires, food frequency assessments, dietary recalls

#### 4.4 Comparator(s)
- Omnivorous diets (regular consumption of animal products)
- Mixed diets with meat consumption

#### 4.5 Dentalator Outcome(s)
**Primary:**
- Depression (clinical diagnosis OR validated scales: PHQ-9, CES-D, MADRS)
- Anxiety disorders (clinical diagnosis OR GAD-7, HARS)
- Cognitive decline/dementia (Alzheimer's, MCI, neuropsychological assessment)

**Secondary:**
- Mental health composite scores
- Subthreshold mental health symptoms
- Cognitive function measures
- Quality of life (mental health domains)

#### 4.6 Duration of follow-up
- Cross-sectional: Single time point assessment
- Longitudinal: ≥6 months preferred, minimum 3 months

### 5. Search Strategy

#### 5.1 Search Strategy Databases
- PubMed/MEDLINE
- EMBASE
- Cochrane CENTRAL
- PsycINFO
- Web of Science
- Scopus
- CINAHL

#### 5.2 Search Strategy Keywords and Synonyms
- Dietary terms: "plant-based diet", "plant based diet", vegetarian*, vegan*, "vegetarian diet", "vegan diet"
- Mental health terms: depression, anxiety, "mental health", cognition, cognitive, dementia, Alzheimer*, "mild cognitive impairment", MCI
- Study design: cohort, prospective, retrospective, cross-sectional, randomized controlled trial

### 6. Data Extraction and Synthesis

#### 6.1 Method for selecting studies
- Dual independent screening (title/abstract and full-text)
- Consensus resolution for disagreements
- Third reviewer arbitration if needed

#### 6.2 Data extraction method
- Duplicate extraction by trained reviewers
- Standardized data extraction forms
- Items: study characteristics, participant demographics, dietary assessment methods, mental health outcomes, effect estimates, adjustment variables, risk of bias

#### 6.3 Risk of bias assessment
**For RCTs:** Cochrane RoB 2 tool
**For observational studies:** Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS)
**For cross-sectional studies:** Adapted NOS criteria
Low-quality studies (NOS <6 for observational, high RoB for RCTs) will be excluded or sensitivity-analysed separately.

#### 6.4 Strategy for data synthesis
- Random-effects meta-analysis
- Odds ratios for binary outcomes, standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes
- 95% confidence intervals for all pooled estimates
- Heterogeneity quantified by I² and Cochran's Q statistics

#### 6.5 Heterogeneity incorporation
- Sources of heterogeneity explored through:
  - Subgroup analyses by study design, diet type, outcome measure, population characteristics
  - Meta-regression for continuous moderators (age, study quality, follow-up duration)
  - Sensitivity analyses excluding high-risk studies

### 7. Analysis Heterogeneity

#### 7.1 Measure of Consistency
- I² statistic interpretation: 0-40% unimportant, 40-60% moderate, 60-75% substantial, 75-100% considerable
- χ² test with p<0.10 indicating significant heterogeneity

#### 7.2 Description of any planned subgroup and sensitivity analyses
**Subgroup analyses:**
- Study design (RCT vs observational vs cross-sectional)
- Diet type (vegan vs vegetarian vs plant-predominant)
- Mental health outcome (depression vs anxiety vs cognitive outcomes)
- Age group (18-39 vs 40-64 vs ≥65 years)
- Geographic region (Western vs Asian vs other)
- Dietary assessment method (FFQ vs diet recall vs diet records)

**Sensitivity analyses:**
- Low-quality studies excluded
- Self-reported outcomes only vs clinical diagnoses
- Short-term (<1 year) vs long-term studies
- Fixed-effects model alternative

#### Statistical Analysis
- Random-effects meta-analysis (DerSimonian-Laird estimator)
- Publication bias evaluation (funnel plots, Egger's test, trim-and-fill)
- GRADE framework for evidence certainty

### 8. Overall Plan for Reporting the Review

#### 8.1 Proposal for reporting
**Results section:** Study selection process, study characteristics, risk of bias assessments, pooled effect estimates with forest plots, subgroup analyses, GRADE evidence certainty
