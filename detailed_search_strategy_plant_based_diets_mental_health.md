# Detailed Search Strategy: Plant-Based Diets and Mental Health Outcomes

## Search Question
Do plant-based or vegetarian diets reduce the risk of depression, anxiety, or cognitive decline compared to omnivorous diets?

## Research Question Components
- **Population:** Adults aged â‰¥18 years
- **Exposure/Intervention:** Plant-based dietary patterns (vegetarian, vegan, plant-predominant)
- **Comparator:** Omnivorous diets (regular animal product consumption)
- **Outcomes:** Mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, cognitive decline)
- **Study Types:** RCTs, cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies

## Search Strategy Development

### Step 1: Concept Identification
1. **Plant-based diets** (vegetarian, vegan, plant-based, plant predominant)
2. **Mental health outcomes** (depression, anxiety, cognition, dementia, Alzheimer*)
3. **Study design** (cohort, prospective, longitudinal, clinical trial)
4. **Dietary assessment** (dietary pattern, food frequency questionnaire, FFQ)

### Step 2: Keyword Mapping
Systematic construction of search terms for comprehensive coverage.

```

### EMBASE Search Strategy
EMBASE requires different field syntax and broader term coverage.

```
#1: 'plant-based diet'/ti,ab OR vegetarian*/ti,ab OR vegan*/ti,ab OR 'plant predominant diet'/ti,ab
#2: depression/ti,ab OR anxiety/ti,ab OR 'mental health'/ti,ab OR cognition/ti,ab OR cognitive/ti,ab OR dementia/ti,ab OR alzheimer*/ti,ab OR 'mild cognitive impairment'/ti,ab OR mci/ti,ab
#3: cohort/ti,ab OR prospective/ti,ab OR longitudinal/ti,ab OR 'clinical trial'/ti,ab OR 'randomized controlled trial'/ti,ab OR 'case control'/ti,ab OR 'cross sectional'/ti,ab OR observational/ti,ab
#4: #1 AND #2 AND #3
```

### Cochrane Library Search Strategy
Uses MeSH terms extensively.

```
#1: MeSH descriptor: [Diets] explode all trees
#2: (plant-based diet OR plant based diet OR vegetarian* OR vegan* OR plant predominant diet):ti,ab,kw
#3: #1 or #2
#4: MeSH descriptor: [Depression] explode all trees
#5: MeSH descriptor: [Anxiety Disorders] explode all trees
#6: MeSH descriptor: [Cognitive Dysfunction] explode all trees
#7: (depression OR anxiety OR mental health OR cognition OR cognitive OR dementia OR Alzheimer* OR mild cognitive impairment):ti,ab,kw
#8: #4 or #5 or #6 or #7
#9: (cohort OR prospective OR longitudinal OR clinical trial OR randomized controlled trial):ti,ab,kw
#10: #3 and #8 and #9
```

### Web of Science Search Strategy
Field-specific tags for precision.

```
TI=((plant-based diet OR plant based diet OR vegetarian* OR vegan* OR plant predominant diet) AND (depression OR anxiety OR mental health OR cognition OR cognitive OR dementia OR Alzheimer* OR mild cognitive impairment))

AND

TS=(cohort OR prospective OR longitudinal OR clinical trial OR randomized controlled trial OR case control OR cross sectional OR observational)

NOT (animal model OR rat OR mouse)
```

### Scopus Search Strategy
Title-abstract-keyword searching.

```
TITLE-ABS-KEY((plant-based diet OR plant based diet OR vegetarian* OR vegan* OR plant predominant diet) AND (depression OR anxiety OR mental health OR cognition OR cognitive OR dementia OR Alzheimer* OR mild cognitive impairment OR MCI) AND (cohort OR prospective OR longitudinal OR clinical trial OR randomized controlled trial OR case-control OR cross-sectional OR observational)) AND NOT (animal model OR rats OR mice OR in vitro)
