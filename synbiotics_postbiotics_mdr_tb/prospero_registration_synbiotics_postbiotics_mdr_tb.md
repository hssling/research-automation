# PROSPERO Registration: Synbiotics and Postbiotics in MDR-TB Treatment Outcomes

**Title:** Do Synbiotics and Postbiotics Improve Treatment Outcomes in Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Beyond Standard Care?: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

**CRD420246789262** - Temporary Registration Number (To be registered with PROSPERO)

---

## Review Question(s)

### Primary Research Question
Do synbiotics or postbiotics improve treatment outcomes in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis when added to standard care compared to standard care alone?

### Secondary Research Questions
1. What are the effects on treatment success rates and time to culture conversion?
2. How do synbiotics/postbiotics influence adverse event profiles of MDR-TB treatment?
3. What implications exist for specific bacterial strains or patient subgroups?
4. What is the microbiologic rationale for observed clinical effects?

- [ ] Intervention reviews
- [ ] Other:

### Condition or Domain Being Studied
- Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)
- Interventions focusing on gut microbiota modulation
- Comparative effectiveness with standard antibacterial treatment

### Participants/Population
- Adult patients (≥18 years) with confirmed MDR-TB
- Pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis
- Patients with comorbidities (HIV, diabetes) included

### Intervention(s), Exposure(s)
- Synbiotics (probiotics + prebiotics)
- Postbiotics (fermentation metabolites/products)
- Administered orally as adjunct to standard MDR-TB treatment
- Minimum 20 participants per study group

### Comparator(s)/Control
- Standard MDR-TB treatment regimen alone (per WHO guidelines)
- Identical standard treatment in both intervention and control groups

### Outcome(s)
- **Primary Outcomes:**
  - Treatment success rate (cured or treatment completed per WHO definitions)
  - Time to sputum culture conversion (weeks)
- **Secondary Outcomes:**
  - All-cause mortality during treatment
  - Treatment interruption rates
  - Adverse drug reaction frequency and severity
  - Quality of life measures
  - Immunological markers (CD4 count, cytokine levels)
  - Microbiota composition changes

**Principal outcome(s):** Treatment success rate and culture conversion time

### Timing
- Outcomes measured during full treatment course (minimum 6 months)
- Follow-up through treatment completion (typically 18-24 months)

## Information Sources and Search Strategy

### Search Strategy
Comprehensive multi-database search covering medical literature, regional databases, and clinical trials registries.

**Core Search Terms:**
((multidrug-resistant tuberculosis OR MDR tuberculosis OR extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis) AND (synbiotic* OR postbiotic* OR probiotic* OR prebiotic* OR microbiome OR microbiota) AND (treatment outcome* OR cure rate* OR conversion time* OR efficacy OR mortality OR adverse event*))

**Sample PubMed Query:**
```
(multidrug-resistant tuberculosis[Title/Abstract] OR MDR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract] OR extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (synbiotic*[Title/Abstract] OR postbiotic*[Title/Abstract] OR probiotic*[Title/Abstract] OR prebiotic*[Title/Abstract] OR microbiota[Title/Abstract] OR microbiome[Title/Abstract]) AND (treatment outcome*[Title/Abstract] OR cure rate*[Title/Abstract] OR clinical trial[Title/Abstract] OR cohort study[Title/Abstract])
```

**Databases:**
1. PubMed/MEDLINE (NLM)
2. EMBASE (Elsevier)
3. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
4. Web of Science Core Collection
5. WHO ICTRP (International Clinical Trials Registry Platform)
6. ClinicalTrials.gov
7. EU Clinical Trials Register
8. Grey literature sources and dissertation databases

**Additional Search Methods:**
- Reference lists of included studies
- Forward citation tracking
- Expert consultations with TB microbiologists and infectious disease specialists
- Regional databases for high-burden countries

**Date Limits:** 2010-present (emergence of gut microbiota research in infectious diseases)

**Language:** English language publications only

## Selection Process and Data Collection

### Screening Process
- Two-stage screening process: title/abstract followed by full-text review
- Two independent reviewers at each stage
- Kappa coefficient assessment for inter-reviewer agreement
- Third reviewer arbitration for discrepancies

### Data Extraction
- Standardized extraction form with quality assessment
- Duplicate extraction with cross-validation
- Study characteristics, participant demographics, intervention details
- Outcome data with numerical denominators
- Risk of bias evaluations per study type

---

## Quantitative Synthesis (Meta-Analysis)

### Analysis Methodology
- **Primary Analysis:** Random-effects meta-analysis with DerSimonian-Laird estimator
- **Effect Measures:** Risk ratios (RR) for binary outcomes, mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes
- **Statistical Software:** R (metafor package), Stata (metan commands)
- **Heterogeneity Assessment:** I² statistic and Cochran's Q test

### Subgroup Analyses
1. By intervention type: synbiotics vs postbiotics
2. By study design: RCTs vs observational studies
3. By geographic region: Asia vs Africa vs Americas vs Europe
4. By HIV status: HIV-positive vs HIV-negative patients
5. By treatment duration: <12 months vs ≥12 months intervention

### Sensitivity Analyses
- Exclusion of high-risk-of-bias studies
- One-study-removed influence analysis
- Alternative statistical models (fixed-effect vs random-effects)
- Analysis restricted to high-quality RCTs

### Bias Assessment
- **Publication Bias:** Funnel plots, Egger's regression test, Duval-Tweedie's trim-and-fill
- **Study Quality:** Cochrane ROB-2.0 for RCTs, ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies
- **Small Study Effects:** Begg-Mazumdar correlation test
