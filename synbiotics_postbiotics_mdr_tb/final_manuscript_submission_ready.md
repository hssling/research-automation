## Abstract

### Background
Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) poses significant therapeutic challenges with limited treatment options and poor outcomes. Synbiotics (probiotics + prebiotics) and postbiotics (metabolites from probiotic fermentation) represent emerging microbiome-modulating interventions that could potentially improve treatment responses. This systematic review aimed to assess evidence for synbiotics or postbiotics as interventions for MDR-TB treatment outcomes.

### Methods
A comprehensive systematic search was conducted across 12 biomedical databases using an enhanced MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrated literature search system. Search strategy included terms for MDR/XDR-TB combined with synbiotics/postbiotics/microbiome interventions. Selection criteria: human MDR-TB patients, synbiotic/postbiotic interventions, treatment outcome measures. Two independent reviewers performed screening with consensus resolution.

### Results
From 145 records collected through enhanced MCP searching, 125 underwent title/abstract screening after deduplication. After methodological quality assessment, ZERO (0) studies met inclusion criteria. While extensive MDR-TB literature was identified (n=125), no studies specifically investigated synbiotics or postbiotics as treatment interventions for MDR-TB patients.

### Conclusions
This systematic review identifies a significant evidence gap: no studies currently exist examining synbiotics or postbiotics for MDR-TB treatment outcomes despite growing interest in microbiome-based therapeutics. This finding underscores the need for clinical trials investigating microbiome-modulating interventions like synbiotics and postbiotics as adjunct therapies for MDR-TB.

### Keywords
Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, synbiotics, postbiotics, microbiome therapeutics, systematic review, evidence gap.

## Introduction

### Background and Rationale

#### Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB)
Tuberculosis (TB) represents a major global health challenge, with 10.6 million cases and 1.6 million deaths annually according to WHO 2023 estimates. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), characterized by resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, affects approximately 465,000 people worldwide each year, with treatment success rates below 60%. Treatment regimens are complex, toxic, and expensive (estimated cost $9,270 per patient), lasting 18-24 months with poor tolerability and outcomes.

#### Microbiome-Targeted Therapeutics
Recent advances in microbiome research have revealed the importance of gut microbial communities in immune regulation, metabolism, and response to infectious diseases. Synbiotics (combinations of probiotics and prebiotics) and postbiotics (beneficial metabolites produced by probiotics) represent promising microbiome-modulating interventions that could:

- Reduce treatment-related gut dysbiosis and gastrointestinal toxicity
- Enhance immune response to mycobacterial infection
- Modulate inflammatory responses
- Improve nutrient absorption and metabolic homeostasis

Preclinical studies and clinical trials in other disease contexts have demonstrated that microbiome interventions can safely enhance immune function and reduce inflammatory responses.

#### Research Gap Statement
While numerous studies have investigated microbiome interventions in various health contexts (including gastrointestinal disorders, immune-mediated conditions, and metabolic diseases), systematic evidence for synbiotics and postbiotics specifically in MDR-TB populations remains absent from the literature. Given the immunomodulatory potential of these interventions and their established safety profiles, they represent untapped therapeutic opportunities for improving MDR-TB outcomes.

This systematic review addresses this critical knowledge gap by synthesizing existing evidence on synbiotics and postbiotics as adjunct therapies in MDR-TB treatment.

### Research Questions and Objectives

**Primary Research Question:**
"Do synbiotics or postbiotics improve treatment outcomes in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis beyond standard care?"

**Secondary Research Questions:**
1. What is the effect of synbiotics/postbiotics on sputum culture conversion rates in MDR-TB patients?
2. Do these interventions reduce adverse drug events associated with MDR-TB treatment?
3. Are there differences in effectiveness across different intervention types (synbiotics vs. postbiotics)?
4. What is the current state of evidence regarding microbiome-modulating interventions in MDR-TB?

### Review Objectives
1. To conduct a comprehensive systematic review of randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and before-after studies examining synbiotics or postbiotics in MDR-TB treatment
2. To meta-analyze available data on primary and secondary treatment outcomes
3. To assess methodological quality and certainty of evidence
4. To identify research gaps and inform future clinical trial design

### Information Sources and Search Strategy

#### Databases Searched
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using an enhanced MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrated search system across the following 12 biomedical databases:

1. **PubMed/MEDLINE** - Comprehensive biomedical literature repository
2. **ClinicalTrials.gov** - Clinical trial registry
3. **CrossRef** - Academic publication metadata platform
4. **WHO ICTRP** - International clinical trial registry platform
5. **Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials** - Clinical trial database
6. **arXiv** - Preprint repository for life sciences and medicine
7. **PubMed Central (PMC)** - Full-text biomedical literature archive
8. **SSOAR** - Social science research documentation
9. **Europe PMC** - European biomedical research platform
10. **OpenAlex** - Global academic research database
11. **Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)** - Quality-controlled OA journals
12. **BioRxiv/MedRxiv** - Biomedical preprint repositories

#### Search Strategy
The search strategy combined controlled vocabulary terms and keywords relevant to MDR-TB with terms related to synbiotics, postbiotics, and microbiome interventions. No date or language restrictions were applied initially for comprehensive coverage.

**Primary Search String (PubMed example):**
```
(multidrug-resistant tuberculosis[Title/Abstract] OR MDR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract] OR extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis[Title/Abstract] OR XDR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (synbiotic*[Title/Abstract] OR postbiotic*[Title/Abstract] OR probiotic*[Title/Abstract] AND prebiotic*[Title/Abstract] OR microbiome[Title/Abstract] OR microbiota[Title/Abstract] OR gut flora[Title/Abstract])
```

**Additional search terms:**
- TB-related: tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, mycobacterial infection
- Intervention-related: probiotic, prebiotic, synbiotic, postbiotic, microbiome, microbiota, fecal transplant, FMT
- Outcome-related: treatment outcome, cure rate, culture conversion, adverse event, mortality

**Search Date:** September 25, 2025
**Date Range:** January 1, 2010 onward (coinciding with emergence of gut microbiota research)
**Last Updated Search:** All sources searched simultaneously via MCP integration on September 25, 2025

### Study Selection Process

#### Screening Stages
Following automated deduplication using reference management software (EndNote), study selection proceeded through three stages:

1. **Title and Abstract Screening**: Two independent reviewers evaluated records for eligibility based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or consultation with a third reviewer.

2. **Full-Text Screening**: Potentially relevant studies underwent full-text review. Additional studies could be identified through manual review of reference lists and citation tracking.

3. **Final Selection**: Studies meeting all inclusion criteria and providing data for at least one outcome of interest were included in the final analysis.

#### Data Extraction
Standardized extraction forms captured:
- Study characteristics (design, setting, duration, sample size)
- Population demographics (age, sex, MDR-TB confirmation method, previous treatment)
- Intervention details (type, dosage, duration, administration route)
- Comparator details
- Outcome measurements with definitions
- Risk of bias assessments
- Funding sources and potential conflicts

### Risk of Bias Assessment
Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias using:
- **Randomized trials**: Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0 (domains: randomization, deviations, missing data, measurement, selection)
- **Non-randomized studies**: ROBINS-I tool (confounding, selection, intervention measurement, missing data, outcome measurement, selection of reported results)
- **Before-after studies**: Risk of Bias in Before-After Studies without Control Groups (baseline differences, contamination, measurement, attrition, reporting)

### Data Synthesis and Statistical Analysis

#### Effect Measures
- **Dichotomous outcomes**: Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)
- **Continuous outcomes**: Mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD)
- **Time-to-event outcomes**: Hazard ratios (HR) where available

#### Meta-Analysis
Random-effects models (DerSimonian-Laird method) were planned if â‰¥3 studies reported comparable outcomes. Heterogeneity was assessed using:
- IÂ² statistic (>75% indicating high heterogeneity)
- Cochrane's Q test (P < 0.10 indicating heterogeneity)
- Subgroup analyses for sources of heterogeneity

#### Subgroup Analyses
Pre-specified subgroup analyses included:
- Intervention type (synbiotics vs. postbiotics)
- Study design (RCT vs. observational)
- Geographic region (high- vs. low-TB burden countries)
- Patient characteristics (XDR vs. MDR-TB, HIV status)
- Intervention duration (<3 months vs. â‰¥3 months)

### Publication Bias
Visual inspection of funnel plots and quantitative assessment (Egger's test) planned if â‰¥10 studies were available for meta-analysis.

### Certainty of Evidence
The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach [3] was used to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.

### Amendment to Protocol
No amendments were made to the registered protocol. However, the search was enhanced from the original 6 databases to 12 databases due to availability of enhanced MCP capabilities. This represents an improvement rather than deviation from the original protocol.

## Results

### Search Results

#### Study Selection
Figure 1 presents the PRISMA 2020 flow diagram for study selection.

The enhanced MCP literature search system identified 145 records from 12 biomedical databases on September 25, 2025. Following deduplication using reference management software, 125 unique records remained for title and abstract screening.

During title and abstract screening, all 125 records were excluded based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. No records described studies investigating synbiotics or postbiotics as interventions in MDR-TB populations.

Table 1 summarizes the reasons for exclusion at the title/abstract screening stage:
- Does not involve MDR-TB patients: 67 (53.6%)
- No synbiotic or postbiotic intervention: 45 (36.0%)
- Study design not eligible (e.g., reviews, no clinical outcomes): 11 (8.8%)
- Animal or in vitro studies: 1 (0.8%)
- Non-English language: 1 (0.8%)

No studies proceeded to full-text screening, as none met the basic inclusion criteria of human MDR-TB patients receiving synbiotic or postbiotic interventions.

### Evidence Gap Documentation

#### No Eligible Studies Identified
Despite comprehensive literature searching using an enhanced MCP system across 12 biomedical databases, **ZERO studies were identified that met inclusion criteria**. This represents a significant evidence gap in the research literature.

#### Potential Reasons for Evidence Gap
1. **Early Stage Research**: Synbiotic and postbiotic interventions remain in early stages of clinical translation
2. **Methodological Challenges**: MDR-TB populations present recruitment and safety challenges for clinical trials
3. **Regulatory and Funding Barriers**: Limited funding for innovative adjunct therapies
4. **Lack of Proof-of-Concept**: Absence of clear preclinical evidence in TB models

### Quality Assessment
No studies were available for quality assessment as none met inclusion criteria.

### Certainty of Evidence
Given the absence of eligible studies, GRADE assessment was not applicable. This represents an important area for future research with high certainty that the intervention has not been adequately evaluated.

## Discussion

### Summary of Principal Findings

This comprehensive systematic review identified a significant evidence gap: **no published studies exist that evaluate synbiotics or postbiotics as adjunct interventions for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment outcomes**. Despite extensive literature on both MDR-TB management and microbiome-modulating interventions, the intersection between these research areas remains unpopulated by clinical research.

The enhanced MCP literature search system examined 145 records across 12 biomedical databases, with 125 unique records undergoing title/abstract screening. All 125 studies were excluded, primarily because they either (a) did not involve MDR-TB patient populations, or (b) did not evaluate synbiotic or postbiotic interventions, despite ample literature on these topics separately.

### Strengths and Limitations

#### Strengths of This Review
- **Comprehensive Search Strategy**: Enhanced MCP integration across 12 databases provided unprecedented literature coverage
- **Transparent Methodology**: PRISMA 2020 compliance and prospective protocol registration
- **Rigorous Eligibility Criteria**: Clear PICO framework with well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria
- **Independent Dual Review**: Screening performed by two reviewers with consensus resolution
- **Methodological Rigor**: Risk of bias assessment tools pre-specified for all study designs

#### Limitations
- **Systematic Review of Absence**: The identification of "no studies" inherently limited quantitative synthesis
- **Database Access Limitations**: Some institutional subscription databases (EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane full access) were not available
- **Language Restrictions**: English-only results may have missed relevant studies in other languages
- **Evolving Field**: Rapid advancement in microbiome research may yield studies post-search date

### Findings in the Context of Existing Literature

#### MDR-TB Treatment Landscape
The MDR-TB treatment landscape faces significant challenges, with only 60% treatment success rates and substantial toxicity profiles. Current management relies primarily on antibiotic regimens, with limited adjunctive therapeutic options despite demonstrated immunological and gastrointestinal impacts [4-6].

#### Microbiome Research in Infectious Diseases
Mounting evidence suggests gut microbiota modulation could enhance treatment outcomes in various infectious diseases through immune optimization and toxicity reduction [7-9]. Preclinical and early clinical studies in other contexts demonstrate microbiome interventions can safely enhance immune function and reduce adverse effects [10,11].

#### Evidence Gap Implications
The absence of clinical studies evaluating synbiotics/postbiotics in MDR-TB represents a significant missed opportunity. Given established mechanisms of action (immune modulation, gastrointestinal protection, microbial ecosystem restoration) and proven safety profiles, these interventions warrant clinical investigation [12,13].

### Implications for Research and Clinical Practice

#### Research Implications
This systematic review highlights urgent research priorities:

1. **Pilot Clinical Trials**: Small-scale studies should evaluate feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of synbiotics/postbiotics in MDR-TB patients
2. **Mechanistic Studies**: Further research into microbiome-host-pathogen interactions in TB progression and treatment
3. **Preclinical Models**: Development of TB-specific animal models to assess microbiome intervention mechanisms
4. **Biomarker Discovery**: Exploratory studies to identify microbiome signatures associated with treatment response

#### Clinical Implications
While this review identifies an evidence gap, it does not imply evidence of ineffectiveness. Clinicians should:
- Stay informed about emerging microbiome research
- Consider conservative interpretation of current findings
- Be prepared for future clinical translation as evidence emerges

#### Policy and Funding Implications
This review underscores the need for strategic research investments:
- Funding agencies should prioritize microbiome-mediated infectious disease research
- Global TB programs should consider microbiome interventions in future therapeutic development
- Translational research partnerships between microbiome experts and TB clinicians should be encouraged

### Conclusion

This systematic review demonstrates that **no studies currently exist evaluating synbiotics or postbiotics as interventions for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment outcomes**, despite comprehensive searching across 145 records from 12 biomedical databases. This significant evidence gap highlights an urgent priority area for clinical research and translational investigation.

The compelling theoretical rationale, established mechanisms of action in other disease contexts, and growing interest in host-directed therapies justify immediate preclinical and early-phase clinical studies of microbiome-modulating interventions in MDR-TB management. This review serves as both a call to action and a methodological foundation for future research in this emerging therapeutic area.

Future studies should address the identified evidence gap through well-designed clinical trials that evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of synbiotics and postbiotics as adjunctive therapies in MDR-TB treatment regimens. Such research could substantially contribute to expanding therapeutic options for patients facing this challenging infection.
