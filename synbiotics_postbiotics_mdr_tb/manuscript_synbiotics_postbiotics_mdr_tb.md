## Abstract

### Background
Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) poses significant therapeutic challenges. Synbiotics and postbiotics represent emerging adjunct interventions targeting gut microbiota modulation.

### Methods
Systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines. Comprehensive search across multiple databases from 2010 onwards. RCTs and cohort studies evaluating synbiotics/postbiotics plus standard MDR-TB treatment versus standard treatment alone were eligible. Primary outcomes: treatment success rate, time to culture conversion. Secondary outcomes: mortality, adverse events, treatment interruptions.

## Introduction

### Background and Rationale
Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), defined as resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, represents one of the most formidable challenges in global tuberculosis control. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 484,000 new MDR-TB cases emerged globally in 2022, with treatment success rates hovering around 60% and mortality rates exceeding 25% in many high-burden settings.

Standard MDR-TB treatment regimens typically last 18-24 months and involve complex combinations of second-line anti-TB drugs associated with substantial adverse effects including gastrointestinal toxicity, hepatotoxicity, psychiatric disorders, and peripheral neuropathy. These adverse effects contribute to poor treatment adherence and outcomes.

Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota plays a crucial immunomodulatory role in tuberculosis pathogenesis. Alterations in gut microbiome composition have been associated with TB disease progression, treatment responses, and immune reconstitution. This has led to exploration of gut microbiota-targeted interventions as adjunct therapies.

Synbiotics (combinations of probiotics and prebiotics) and postbiotics (metabolites and components derived from probiotic fermentation) represent promising approaches for microbiome modulation. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that these interventions can enhance intestinal barrier function, modulate systemic inflammation, reduce drug-induced gastrointestinal toxicity, and potentially improve host immune responses against mycobacterial infection.

### Research Gap and Objectives
While several studies have examined probiotics in drug-sensitive TB, systematic evaluation of synbiotics and postbiotics specifically in MDR-TB populations remains limited. Available studies are heterogeneous in design, interventions, and outcomes, preventing definitive conclusions about clinical utility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to synthesize existing evidence on synbiotics and postbiotics as adjunct therapies in MDR-TB treatment.

**Primary Objective:** To evaluate whether synbiotics or postbiotics improve treatment outcomes in MDR-TB beyond standard care.

**Secondary Objectives:**
1. To assess effects on sputum culture conversion rates and time to conversion
2. To evaluate impact on adverse drug reaction profiles
3. To explore intervention effects across different patient subgroups
4. To identify microbiological mechanisms underlying observed clinical effects

## Methods

### Protocol and Registration
This review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD420246789262) on September 25, 2025.

### Eligibility Criteria

#### Population
Adult patients (≥18 years) with confirmed MDR-TB (resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid by phenotypic or genotypic methods). Studies including XDR-TB patients were eligible.

#### Intervention
- **Synbiotics:** Any combination of live microorganisms (probiotics) and fermentable substrates (prebiotics) administered for microbiota modulation
- **Postbiotics:** Any non-viable microbial products (metabolites, cell wall components, short-chain fatty acids) derived from probiotic fermentation

Interventions must be administered as adjuncts to standard WHO-recommended MDR-TB treatment regimens.

#### Comparator
Standard MDR-TB treatment alone (same regimen in both intervention and comparator groups for head-to-head comparisons).

#### Outcomes
- **Primary:** Treatment success rate (cured + treatment completed per WHO definitions), time to sputum culture conversion
- **Secondary:** All-cause mortality, treatment interruption rates, adverse drug reactions (gastrointestinal, hepatotoxicity, neurological), quality of life, immunological markers, microbiota composition changes

#### Study Designs
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomized trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies with concurrent controls. Case series, cross-sectional studies, and animal studies excluded.

### Information Sources and Search Strategy
Comprehensive literature search across: PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, WHO ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, and regional databases. Search from 2010 onwards (emergence of gut microbiota research). No language restrictions applied.

Example PubMed search:  
```
(multidrug-resistant tuberculosis[Title/Abstract] OR MDR tuberculosis[Title/Abstract]) AND (synbiotic*[Title/Abstract] OR postbiotic*[Title/Abstract] OR probiotic*[Title/Abstract] OR microbiome[Title/Abstract] OR microbiota[Title/Abstract]) AND (treatment outcome*[Title/Abstract] OR clinical trial[Publication Type])
```

### Study Selection and Data Collection
Two independent reviewers screened titles/abstracts then full texts using Covidence software. Discrepancies resolved by third reviewer. Standardized forms used for data extraction including study characteristics, population demographics, intervention details, and outcome measures.

### Risk of Bias Assessment
Cochrane ROB-2 tool for RCTs; ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies. Domains assessed: randomization, deviations from interventions, missing data, measurement of outcomes, selection of reported results.

### Statistical Analysis
Random-effects meta-analysis for primary outcomes. Heterogeneity assessed using I² statistic and Cochran's Q test. Risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes, mean differences for continuous outcomes. Subgroup analyses by intervention type, study design, and geographic region. Publication bias assessed via funnel plots and Egger's test.

### Certainty of Evidence
GRADE approach for evidence quality assessment across outcomes.
