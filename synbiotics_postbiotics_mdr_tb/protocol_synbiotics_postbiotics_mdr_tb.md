# Protocol: Synbiotics and Postbiotics in Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) Treatment

**Systematic Review Title:** Do Synbiotics and Postbiotics Improve Treatment Outcomes in Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Beyond Standard Care?: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

**Registration:** To be registered on PROSPERO
**Authors:** AI Research Automation System v2.5
**Date:** September 25, 2025

## Background and Rationale

Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) poses significant global health challenges with limited treatment options and high mortality rates. Standard MDR-TB regimens are lengthy (18-24 months), expensive, and associated with substantial adverse effects, complicating adherence and outcomes.

Gut microbiota modulation through synbiotics (combinations of probiotics and prebiotics) and postbiotics (metabolites or components from probiotic fermentation) represents a novel therapeutic approach. Emerging evidence suggests these microbial interventions could enhance treatment efficacy by improving immune response, reducing inflammation, mitigating adverse drug effects, and potentially reducing mycobacterial burden.

Current studies examining synbiotics/postbiotics in TB are limited and inconclusive. This systematic review aims to synthesize evidence on their impact on MDR-TB treatment outcomes to guide clinical practice and inform future research directions.

## Research Questions

**Primary Question:**
Do synbiotics or postbiotics improve treatment outcomes in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis when added to standard care compared to standard care alone?

**Secondary Questions:**
1. What are the effects on treatment success rates and time to culture conversion?
2. How do synbiotics/postbiotics influence adverse event profiles of MDR-TB treatment?
3. What implications exist for specific bacterial strains or patient subgroups?
4. What is the microbiologic rationale for observed clinical effects?

## Methods

### Study Selection Process

#### Screening Stages
1. **Title/abstract screening** by two independent reviewers using eligibility criteria
2. **Full-text screening** for eligible studies with detailed assessment
3. **Data extraction** using standardized forms with quality assessment

#### Quality Control
- Kappa statistic for inter-reviewer agreement (>0.80 required)
- Discrepancies resolved by senior reviewer
- Pilot testing with 25 articles before full screening

### Data Collection and Management

#### Data Extraction Form
- **Study characteristics:** Author, year, design, location, follow-up duration
- **Population details:** Sample size, age, sex, HIV status, diabetes status, baseline disease severity
- **Intervention details:** Type of synbiotic/postbiotic, dosage, duration, administration route
- **Comparator details:** Standard regimen composition and duration
- **Outcome measures:** Numerator/denominator for each outcome, timing of assessment
- **Risk of bias assessment and study quality scores

#### Data Management
- Dual extraction with validation
- Excel-based data repository
- Comprehensive audit trail maintained

### Risk of Bias Assessment

#### RCTs
- Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool
- Domains: randomization, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement, selection of reported result

#### Non-Randomized Studies
- ROBINS-I tool for cohort studies
- Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for case-control studies
- Sensitivity analyses excluding high-risk studies

### Statistical Analysis

#### Meta-Analysis Strategy
- Random-effects model for between-study heterogeneity
- Risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes
- Mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) for continuous outcomes
- Heterogeneity quantified using I² statistic (>50% indicating substantial heterogeneity)

#### Subgroup Analyses
1. **Intervention type:** Synbiotics vs postbiotics
2. **Disease severity:** Pulmonary MDR-TB vs XDR-TB
3. **Patient characteristics:** HIV-positive vs HIV-negative, diabetic vs non-diabetic
