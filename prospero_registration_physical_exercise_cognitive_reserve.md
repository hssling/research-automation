# PROSPERO Registration: Physical Activity Modalities and Cognitive Reserve in Aging

## Registration Details
**Title**: Effect of Different Physical Activity Modalities on Cognitive Reserve and Dementia Prevention in Adults Over 60 Years: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis

**Review question(s)**:
Which type of physical activity (aerobic exercise, resistance training, or mind-body exercises like yoga or tai chi) is most effective at enhancing cognitive reserve and delaying dementia onset in adults aged 60 years and older?

**Eligibility criteria**
**Study designs**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, quasi-experimental studies with control groups

**Participants**: Adults aged 60 years or older, community-dwelling, without diagnosed dementia at baseline. Studies must report mean age â‰¥60 or be focused on elderly populations.

**Interventions**: Aerobic exercise, resistance training, mind-body exercises (yoga, tai chi), or combinations thereof

**Comparators**: Sedentary lifestyle, usual care, or active control groups

**Outcomes**: Primary: Cognitive reserve measures (composite cognitive scores, executive function, global cognition)
Secondary: Dementia incidence, cognitive decline indicators, neuroimaging measures of brain reserve

**Length of follow-up**: Minimum intervention period of 12 weeks

**Other**: English language studies only

## Methods
**Information sources**: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PsycINFO, Web of Science

**Search strategy**:
Full search strategy available from the protocol. Example PubMed strategy:
(aged[MeSH] OR elderly OR "older adult"[tiab] OR senior) AND (exercise[MeSH] OR "physical activity" OR aerobic OR resistance OR "strength training" OR yoga OR tai chi) AND ("cognitive reserve" OR cognition[MeSH] OR "cognitive function" OR dementia[MeSH] OR "cognitive decline") AND (clinical trial[pt] OR randomized controlled trial[pt] OR controlled clinical trial)

**Language/date restrictions**: English language, no date restrictions

**Citation data management**: ENDNOTE or Zotero for reference management, COVIDENCE for screening and data extraction

**Study selection process**: Two independent reviewers will screen titles/abstracts, then full texts. Disagreements resolved by third reviewer.

**Data collection process**: Two reviewers will extract data independently using standardized forms. Includes study characteristics, intervention details, outcomes, and quality assessment.

**Data items**: Study design, sample size, participant demographics, intervention protocol (type, frequency, duration, intensity), outcome measures, effect sizes, risk of bias

**Risk of bias assessment**: Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 for RCTs, ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies

**Effect measures**: Standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes, odds ratio (OR) for binary outcomes (dementia incidence)

**Findings synthesis**: Pair-wise meta-analysis using random effects model, network meta-analysis using Bayesian approach (MCMC methods) for ranking interventions. Surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curves to rank effectiveness.

**Justification for mixed-treatment comparisons**: Different physical activity modalities have been studied separately, with limited direct head-to-head comparisons. Network meta-analysis will allow comparison of interventions indirectly and provide ranking of effectiveness.

**Confidence assessment**: Confidence in the evidence will be assessed using GRADE framework.

**Statistical software**: R software (netmeta and gemtc packages) for network meta-analysis

**Sensitivity/subgroup analysis**: By study quality, intervention duration, participant baseline cognitive status

**Publication bias assessment**: Funnel plots, Egger's test for pairwise comparisons; network inconsistency tests for NMA

**Studies already registered**: No related reviews registered in PROSPERO for this specific question
