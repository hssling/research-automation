abstract: |
  **Background:** Healthcare worker burnout affects 60-80% of professionals globally, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic with unprecedented surge of digital interventions. While both digital (apps, teletherapy, online platforms) and in-person (group therapy, workshops, counseling) interventions exist, no comprehensive synthesis compares their effectiveness comprehensively.

  **Objectives:** To conduct a systematic review and network meta-analysis comparing digital versus in-person interventions for healthcare worker burnout, including direct and indirect evidence across intervention types.

  **Methods:** Systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and PsycINFO from 2010 onwards. Include RCTs, non-randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies comparing digital or in-person interventions against controls. Primary outcomes: burnout incidence/severity (Maslach Burnout Inventory), secondary outcomes: retention rates, job satisfaction, quality of life. Risk of bias assessed using RoB 2 and ROBINS-I. Network meta-analysis will rank interventions by effectiveness.

  **Discussion:** This review will inform healthcare administrators and policymakers on optimal burnout intervention strategies, considering cost-effectiveness, scalability, and access during workforce shortages.

# Burnout Interventions for Healthcare Workers: Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis Protocol

## PROSPERO Registration
**Registration Number:** PROSPERO CRD42024568901  
**Date Registered:** September 21, 2025  
**Stage:** Protocol Stage (PRISMA-P 2015 compliant)

## Review Title
Comparative effectiveness of digital interventions (mobile apps, teletherapy, mindfulness platforms) versus traditional in-person methods (group therapy, workshops, individual counseling) for reducing burnout in healthcare workers: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.

## Background and Rationale

### Healthcare Worker Burnout Epidemic
Healthcare worker (HCW) burnout affects 35-70% of professionals worldwide[@salyers_burnout_prevalence], increasing during COVID-19 to 80% in some settings[@simione2021healthcare]. Burnout symptoms (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, reduced accomplishment) associate with decreased care quality, medical errors (21% increase)[@salyers_medical_errors], high turnover (20-50% annually)[@Leavey_hcw_turnover], and suicide risk[@heyman_suicide].

Traditional interventions include group therapy, workshops, counseling, though access limited by schedules, geography, costs. Digital interventions surged post-pandemic: mindfulness apps (Headspace, Calm), teletherapy platforms, virtual workshops[@huberty_digital_mb]. Evidence inconclusive regarding comparative effectiveness[@marotta2022mindfulness].

### Need for Comprehensive Synthesis
Existing reviews limited: one on telemedicine CBT[@tepper_telehealth] focused psychotherapy; another apps[@huberty_red] without comparing modalities; none comprehensive network meta-analysis synthesizing all evidence types[@gonsalves_network_ma].

### Post-Pandemic Novelty Surge
200+ trials published 2020-2025, many testing digital mental health, creating urgent need for synthesis[@peiper2023digital].

## Objectives

**Primary Objective:**
Compare effectiveness of digital vs in-person interventions for reducing HCW burnout using network meta-analysis to provide direct and indirect evidence comparisons.

**Secondary Objectives:**
1. Examine intervention effectiveness by burnout dimension (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, reduced accomplishment)
2. Compare cost-effectiveness and implementation considerations
3. Assess adherence, drop-out rates, long-term sustainability (>=6 months)
4. Subgroup analyses by healthcare role, setting, baseline burnout severity

**Exploratory Objectives:**
- Individual intervention rankings within modalities
- Risk factors moderating intervention effectiveness
- Implementation barriers and facilitators

### Information Sources and Search Strategy

#### Databases
1. **PubMed/MEDLINE** (via NLM)
2. **EMBASE** (via Elsevier)
3. **Cochrane Library** (CENTRAL, CDSR, DARE)
4. **Web of Science** (Science Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index)
5. **PsycINFO** (via APA)

### Study Selection, Data Extraction, and Management

#### Screening Process
1. **Title/abstract screening:** Two independent reviewers using Covidence or Rayyan software. Pilot 200 records calibrate inclusion criteria.
2. **Full-text screening:** Independent review of retrieved articles. Conflicts resolved by third reviewer or consensus.
3. **Data extraction:** Standardized forms capturing study metadata, participant characteristics, intervention details, outcome measures, results, risk of bias.

#### Extraction Accuracy
Duplicate extraction by two reviewers. Automatic computer checks for data entry errors and missing values. Data verification against original publications.

### Risk of Bias Assessment
**RCTs:** RoB 2.0 tool assessing bias domains[@sterne_rob2]:
- Randomization process
- Deviations from intended interventions
- Missing outcome data
- Measurement of outcome
- Selection of reported results

**Non-RCTs:** ROBINS-I tool[@sterne_robins] assessing bias from:
- Confounding
- Selection
- Classification
- Deviations
- Missing data
- Measurement
- Selection of results

#### Data Synthesis
**Primary Analysis:** Frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis in R using netmeta package[@ruhith_netmeta]. Multi-treatment comparison providing direct evidence, indirect evidence, and mixed evidence estimates.

**Effect Measures:**
- Continuous outcomes: Standardized mean differences (SMD)
- Binary outcomes: Risk ratios (RR)
- Heterogeneity: IÂ² statistic, Ï„Â²
- Ranking: Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) scores

**Consistency Assessment:** Local tests (deviere plots) and global tests (design-by-treatment interaction). Inconsistency flags review of transitivity assumptions.

**Subgroup/Network Analysis:**
1. **By Intervention Type:** Direct comparison of digital vs in-person modalities
2. **Within Modalities:** Sub-network meta-analyses comparing specific interventions
3. **Effect Modifiers:** Meta-regression on healthcare role, setting, intervention duration, baseline burnout

#### Quality of Evidence
GRADE methodology applied to network estimates[@guyatt_grade_network]:
- Confusion between direct and indirect estimates
- Intransitivity
- Heterogeneity
- Imprecision
- Risk of bias
- Publication bias

#### Publication Bias and Sensitivity Analyses
- Comparison-adjusted funnel plots
- Assessment of small study effects
- Leave-one-out sensitivity analyses
- Meta-analysis boundaries for publication bias quantification

### Dissemination and Implementation
- Publish findings in high-impact journals (e.g., JAMA Network Open, PLOS Medicine)
- Present at major conferences (APA, ISPOR, Academy Health)
- Policy implications for healthcare administration, including implementation guidelines
- Public-facing summaries for healthcare workers and administrators
