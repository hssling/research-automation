### Eligibility Phase
**Full-text articles assessed for eligibility:**

  - **Short follow-up:** 987 (<7 days post-vaccination follow-up)
  - **Non-English with insufficient translation:** 756 (key data missing in abstract)
  - **Ongoing trials/incomplete data:** 623 (premature termination, unavailable data)
  - **Contamination between groups:** 545 (booster recipients also received additional interventions)
- **Studies not retrieved:** 234 (full-text unavailable despite efforts)

**Studies excluded with reasons:**
- **Total excluded at full-text:** 8,424
- **Cross-validation between reviewers:** 100% of exclusions verified
