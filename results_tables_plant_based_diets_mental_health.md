## Sensitivity Analyses

### Influence Analysis (Leave-One-Out)
- **Depression:** Point estimates ranged from OR = 0.79 to 0.83
- **Anxiety:** Point estimates ranged from OR = 0.84 to 0.90
- **Cognitive Decline:** Point estimates ranged from OR = 0.76 to 0.82
- **Conclusion:** Results stable, no single study disproportionately influencing overall effect

### Quality-Effect Meta-Regression
Quality scores (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) accounted for approximately 15% of heterogeneity in depression studies, suggesting moderate influence of study quality on effect size estimates.

### Dose-Response Relationship
Exploratory analysis showed stronger associations with longer durations of plant-based diet adherence and higher proportions of plant-based foods in the diet.

## Additional Analyses

### Network Meta-Analysis
Direct and indirect comparisons between different types of plant-based diets showed vegetarian diets having the strongest effect sizes, followed by plant-predominant and vegan diets. No statistically significant differences between diet types were detected.

### Meta-Regression Analyses
- Longer follow-up duration associated with stronger effect sizes (β = -0.012, p = 0.023)
- Higher study quality (NOS score) associated with moderate attenuation of effect (β = 0.089, p = 0.034)
- Geographic region showed minimal moderating effect
- Publication year showed no temporal trends

### Subgroup Analyses Results
Results were consistent across geographic regions (Europe, North America, Asia), age groups, and sex-specific subgroups. Stronger effects observed in populations with precise dietary assessments (e.g., multiple 24-hour recalls vs. food frequency questionnaires).

### Limitations Summary
- Moderate to substantial heterogeneity requires cautious interpretation
- Limited RCT evidence (12 studies total across outcomes)
- Potential for residual confounding despite statistical adjustments
- Mostly observational evidence limits causal inference

### Clinical Implications
Plant-based diets appear beneficial for mental health, with approximately 20-25% risk reduction across major outcomes. Strongest evidence for cognitive protection and depression prevention. Clinical trials should confirm optimal duration and composition of plant-based diet interventions.
