# Protocol: Vaccine Effectiveness in Polluted Urban Environments - Ecological Longitudinal Study

## **Study Title**
The Impact of Air Pollution on Vaccine Effectiveness: An Ecological Study of Urban Areas (2010-2025)

---

## **1. Background and Rationale**

### **1.1 Immunological Context**
Air pollution, particularly PM₂.₅ and NO₂, has been shown to influence immune function through multiple pathways including:
- Respiratory epithelial barrier disruption
- Oxidative stress induction leading to inflammatory cytokine release
- Altered T-cell differentiation and antibody production
- Impaired mucosal immunity in respiratory tract surfaces
- Enhanced immunosuppressive regulatory cell populations

### **1.2 Vaccine-Air Pollution Hypothesis**
The hypothesis posits that chronic air pollution exposure may reduce vaccine-induced immunity by interfering with:
- Antibody titer magnitude following vaccination
- Cell-mediated immune responses crucial for intracellular pathogen control
- Immunological memory formation and long-term protection
- T-cell mediated inflammation required for certain vaccine types

### **1.3 Public Health Policy Relevance**
With millions of urban dwellers exposed to high pollution levels and undergoing routine vaccination programs, understanding air pollution-vaccine effectiveness interactions is critical for:
- Optimizing vaccine deployment strategies in polluted regions
- Adjusting vaccination schedules in high-pollution environments
- Designing supplementary interventions for at-risk populations
- Resource allocation in national immunization programs

## **2. Research Objectives**

### **2.1 Primary Objective**
To examine the ecological association between long-term air pollution exposure (PM₂.₅ and NO₂) and vaccine effectiveness across diverse urban populations from 2010-2025.

### **2.2 Secondary Objectives**
1. **Vaccine-Specific Effects**: Assess if pollution affects different vaccine types variably (inactivated vs live vaccines)
2. **Exposure Intensity**: Evaluate dose-response relationships between pollution levels and vaccine effectiveness
3. **Temporal Patterns**: Investigate seasonal and long-term trends in pollution-vaccine effectiveness associations
4. **Geographic Variation**: Compare associations across different pollution profiles and healthcare systems
5. **Population Subgroups**: Identify susceptibility differences by age, sex, and socioeconomic status

## **3. Study Design**

### **3.1 Study Type**
Ecological longitudinal panel study with mixed epidemiological designs:
- **Primary Design**: Panel data regression using state-prefecture level data
- **Secondary Design**: Time-series analysis of vaccination campaigns in polluted areas
- **Tertiary Design**: Cross-sectional ecological comparisons across pollution gradients

### **3.2 Study Period**
January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2025 (16 years of observation)

### **3.3 Geographic Units**
Urban areas in high-pollution regions globally:
- **Primary Focus**: New Delhi, Beijing, Mexico City, Mumbai, Johannesburg
- **Comparative Areas**: Medium-pollution cities in same countries as controls
- **Global Sample**: 100+ urban areas across 25 countries

### **3.4 Aggregation Level**
District/precinct-level analysis with temporal aggregation to monthly observations

### **3.5 Ecological Study Considerations**
- **Strength**: Natural experimental conditions where pollution varies substantially
- **Limitation**: Ecological fallacy addressed through statistical controls and multilevel modeling
- **Validation**: Individual-level studies planned as follow-up to ecological findings

## **5. Statistical Methodology**

### **5.1 Primary Statistical Model**

#### **Panel Data Regression with Fixed Effects**
```
Vaccine_Effectiveness_{it} = β₀ + β₁ PM₂.₅_{i,t-12} + β₂ NO₂_{i,t-6} +
                               β₃ Vaccination_Coverage_it + β₄ Socioeconomic_Factors_it +
                               β₅ Demographic_Factors_it + α_i + δ_t + ε_{it}
```

Where:
- Vaccine_Effectiveness_{it} = Standardized vaccine effectiveness measure in area i at time t
- PM₂.₅_{i,t-12} = 12-month average PM₂.₅ exposure in area i through time t
- α_i = Area-specific fixed effects capturing time-invariant heterogeneity
- δ_t = Year-fixed effects controlling for national trends
- ε_{it} = Residual error term with cluster-robust standard errors

### **5.2 Vaccine-Response Doselięg Response Analysis**
```
Vaccine_Effectiveness = β₀ + ∑_{k=1}^{4} β₀ PM₂.₅ × I(PM₂.₅_category = k) + confounders + α_i + ε_{it}
```

**PM₂.₅ Categories:**
- Low: 0-15 µg/m³
- Moderate: 15-30 µg/m³
- High: 30-45 µg/m³
- Very High: >45 µg/m³

### **5.3 Interaction Analysis**
```
Vaccine_Effectiveness = β₀ + β₁ PM₂.₅ + β₂ Vaccine_Type + β₃ PM₂.₅ × Vaccine_Type + confounders + α_i + ε_{it}
```

**Vaccine Type Interactions:**
- Live vs inactivated vaccines
- Single vs combination vaccines
- Oral vs injectable routes
- High vs low antigen doses
