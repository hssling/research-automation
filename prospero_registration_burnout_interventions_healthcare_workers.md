## Section 3: What are the inclusion criteria for this review?

### Types of studies
**Intervention studies:** Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs), quasi-experimental studies with control groups.

**Minimum study criteria:** Minimum 10 participants per group, post-intervention follow-up assessment, use of validated burnout measures.

**Exclusion:** Pre-post studies without control groups, case reports, qualitative studies, protocols, commentaries, conference abstracts only.

### Types of participants
**Healthcare workers:** Licensed physicians, nurses, pharmacists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, respiratory therapists, social workers, and other clinical healthcare personnel in hospital, primary care, or community settings.

**Age restrictions:** Adults aged ≥18 years.

**Other restrictions:** Must be actively working as clinical healthcare providers.

**Exclusion:** Medical students, residents in training, allied health students, primarily administrative staff, non-clinical healthcare workers.

### Types of interventions
**Digital interventions (target):**
- Mobile apps (mindfulness, stress management, CBT-based)
- Teletherapy/telerehabilitation platforms
- Web-based virtual workshops
- Text/SMS-based coaching interventions
- AI chatbots for mindfulness/CBT
- Virtual peer support communities

**Traditional in-person interventions (comparator):**
- Group therapy/counseling sessions (≥4 sessions)
- Workplace stress management workshops
- Individual counseling/psychotherapy
- Team-building interventions with burnout focus
- Peer support group programs

### Types of outcome measures
**Primary outcomes:**
- Burnout incidence or severity measured by Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, or other validated tools
- MBI subscale scores: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, reduced personal accomplishment

**Secondary outcomes:**
- Retention metrics (turnover rates, intent-to-leave)
- Job satisfaction scales (JSS, PSS)
- Mental health symptoms (GAD-7 for anxiety, PHQ-9 for depression, validated scales)
- Quality of life measures (SF-12, WHOQOL-BREF)
- Work performance indicators where reported
- Cost-effectiveness if reported

### Types of settings
Any healthcare setting: hospitals (inpatient/outpatient), primary care clinics, community health centers, long-term care facilities, emergency departments, intensive care units.

### Language restriction applied
English language publications for full-text review (initial screen). No language restrictions at title/abstract screening stage.

### Date limits
**Start date:** January 1, 2010
**End date:** Present (ongoing search through December 2025)

**Reasoning:** 2010 start date to capture pre-COVID burnout interventions while focusing on contemporary evidence. The intervention landscape dramatically changed post-2020 with pandemic-related surge in digital mental health.

- Participant details (N, profession, setting, baseline burnout)
- Intervention details (format, duration, frequency, delivery method)
- Comparison details
- Risk of bias assessments
- Effect sizes for all outcomes (with SD/SE/CI)

**Extraction method:** Independent dual extraction by two reviewers. Disagreements resolved by consensus or third reviewer. Data verification against original publications.

### Risk of bias (quality) assessment
**RCTs:** Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool[@higgins_rob2]
- Randomization process
- Deviations from intended interventions

**NRCTs:** ROBINS-I tool[@sterne_robins]
- Confounding bias
- Selection bias
- Classification bias
- Measurement bias
