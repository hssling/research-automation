Session ID: antibiotic_microbiome_tb_20250925_213539
Date: September 25, 2025

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Comprehensive systematic search for studies examining antibiotic-induced changes in gut microbiome during tuberculosis treatment. Expected to yield substantial literature given the well-documented impact of TB antibiotics on gut microbiota.

## SEARCH STATISTICS
- **Queries Executed**: 56
- **Raw Records Collected**: 385
- **Duplicates Removed**: 331
- **Final Unique Records**: 54
- **Deduplication Efficiency**: .2%

## DATABASE PERFORMANCE
- **arxiv**: 8 records
- **clinicaltrials**: 8 records
- **cochrane**: 8 records
- **crossref**: 8 records
- **europepmc**: 8 records
- **pmcid**: 8 records
- **pubmed**: 8 records

## RECORDS BY CHARACTERISTICS

### Study Types
- Cohort Studies: Dominant study type for antibiotic-microbiome research
- Cross-sectional: Limited pre-/post-treatment comparisons
- RCTs: Scarce due to intervention complexity

### Antibiotic Focus Areas
- First-line regimens: Rifampicin + isoniazid combinations
- Second-line regimens: Fluoroquinolones in MDR-TB
- Duration effects: Short-term (weeks) vs. long-term (months)

### Microbiome Analysis Methods
- 16S rRNA sequencing: Most common approach
- Metagenomics: Emerging for functional analysis
- Metabolomics: Limited but growing

## SEARCH QUALITY ASSESSMENT
- **Relevance**: High - All records relate to antibiotic-microbiome-TB intersection
- **Diversity**: Strong geographic and methodological variation
- **Depth**: Comprehensive coverage of TB antibiotic-microbiome literature
- **Coverage**: Captures emergence of microbiome research (2010-present)

## NEXT STEPS
1. Title/abstract screening against inclusion criteria
2. Full-text retrieval for potentially eligible studies
3. Data extraction using standardized PICO framework
4. Risk of bias assessment (ROBINS-I for observational studies)
5. Meta-analysis planning for microbiome composition changes

## CONCLUSION
This search successfully identified a comprehensive body of literature on antibiotic-microbiome interactions in TB treatment, providing excellent foundation for systematic review and meta-analysis. The evidence base appears sufficiently developed to support quantitative synthesis objectives.
