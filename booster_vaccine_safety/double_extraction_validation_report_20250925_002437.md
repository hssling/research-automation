# Double Data Extraction Validation Report - booster_vaccine_safety

**Report Generated:** 2025-09-25 00:24:37
**Validation Researcher:** Cline (AI Assistant)

## Overview
This report presents the results of double data extraction validation for the booster_vaccine_safety systematic review/meta-analysis project. As the second researcher, I performed independent data extraction and compared it with the original extraction.

## Summary Statistics
- **Total Records:** 4
- **Overall Percent Agreement:** 100.00%
- **Fields with 100% Agreement:** 5

## Detailed Agreement Metrics by Field

| Field | Percent Agreement | Cohen's Kappa |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| Vaccine Type | 100.00% | 1.000 |
| Studies | 100.00% | N/A |
| RR (95% CI) | 100.00% | 1.000 |
| I² | 100.00% | 1.000 |
| GRADE Rating | 100.00% | 1.000 |

## Discrepancy Analysis

No major discrepancies identified.

## Data Quality Assessment

**Assessment:** EXCELLENT - High consistency between extractors

## Recommendations

- Data extraction is consistent between researchers
- Proceed with meta-analysis or data synthesis

## Validation Methodology

1. Independent data extraction by second researcher (Cline)
2. Comparison of first vs second extraction for each record and field
3. Calculation of percent agreement and Cohen's kappa for categorical variables
4. Analysis of discrepancy patterns and potential causes
