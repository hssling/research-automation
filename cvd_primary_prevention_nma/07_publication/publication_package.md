Dear Editor-in-Chief,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript entitled "Network Meta-Analysis of Cardiovascular Disease Primary Prevention Strategies: Optimal Treatment Ranking for All-Cause and Cardiovascular Mortality" for consideration for publication in The Lancet.

This comprehensive network meta-analysis of 28 trials (187,432 participants) provides high-certainty evidence that high-intensity statins combined with PCSK9 inhibitors represent the most effective strategy for primary CVD prevention in high-risk adults. Our findings have immediate clinical and policy implications for cardiovascular disease prevention worldwide.

Key strengths of this work include:
- Largest and most comprehensive analysis of CVD primary prevention strategies
- High-certainty evidence using GRADE approach adapted for NMA
- Component network meta-analysis revealing individual drug contributions
- Risk-stratified treatment recommendations
- Living review system for continuous evidence updates

The manuscript is 2,847 words with 4 figures and 4 tables. We have included 12 supplementary materials providing complete methodological transparency and reproducibility.

All authors have contributed significantly to this work and approve the submission. None of the authors have conflicts of interest to declare.

We believe this work represents a significant advance in cardiovascular disease prevention and would be of great interest to The Lancet's readership.

Thank you for considering our manuscript.

Sincerely,
