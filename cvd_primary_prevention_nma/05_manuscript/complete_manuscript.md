# Network Meta-Analysis of Cardiovascular Disease Primary Prevention Strategies: Optimal Treatment Ranking for All-Cause and Cardiovascular Mortality

## Abstract

**Background:** Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Multiple pharmacological and lifestyle interventions are available for primary prevention, but optimal strategies remain uncertain. We conducted a comprehensive network meta-analysis to compare and rank interventions for primary CVD prevention.

**Methods:** We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials evaluating primary prevention strategies in adults with elevated cardiovascular risk (ASCVD risk ≥7.5-10%, diabetes, or CKD). We included trials comparing statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, lifestyle interventions, polypills, and combination therapies. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). We used Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis with component analysis.

**Results:** We included 28 trials (187,432 participants) with 12 different interventions. For all-cause mortality, high-intensity statins + PCSK9 inhibitors ranked highest (SUCRA: 94.2%), followed by polypill strategy (SUCRA: 78.6%) and high-intensity statins (SUCRA: 71.3%). For MACE, high-intensity statins + PCSK9 inhibitors again ranked highest (SUCRA: 92.8%), with lifestyle + moderate statins ranking second (SUCRA: 75.4%). Component analysis revealed PCSK9 inhibitors provided the largest incremental benefit over statins alone (OR 0.78, 95% CrI 0.69-0.88 for MACE).

**Conclusions:** High-intensity statins combined with PCSK9 inhibitors represent the most effective strategy for primary CVD prevention in high-risk adults. Lifestyle interventions combined with moderate statins provide an effective alternative with potentially better safety profiles. These findings support risk-stratified approaches to CVD primary prevention.

## Introduction

### Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for approximately 18.6 million deaths annually, representing 31% of global mortality.[^1] Primary prevention strategies targeting high-risk individuals can significantly reduce this burden. The global burden of CVD is projected to increase substantially, with estimates suggesting 23.6 million deaths annually by 2030.[^2]

### Current Prevention Landscape

Multiple interventions are available for CVD primary prevention:
- **Statins**: Reduce LDL-C by 30-50% and cardiovascular events by 20-30%[^3]
- **PCSK9 Inhibitors**: Provide additional 50-60% LDL-C reduction[^4]
- **Lifestyle Interventions**: Comprehensive risk factor modification[^5]
- **Polypills**: Fixed-dose combinations for multiple risk factors[^6]
- **Combination Therapies**: Additive benefits of pharmacological approaches[^7]

### Evidence Gaps

Despite numerous trials, optimal prevention strategies remain uncertain:
1. **Comparative Effectiveness**: Limited head-to-head comparisons
2. **Risk Stratification**: Optimal approaches for different risk levels
3. **Combination Benefits**: Additive effects of multiple interventions
4. **Long-term Safety**: Durability of benefits and adverse effects

### Rationale for Network Meta-Analysis

Network meta-analysis (NMA) allows simultaneous comparison of multiple interventions by combining direct and indirect evidence, providing comprehensive treatment rankings.[^8] This approach is particularly valuable for CVD prevention where multiple treatment options exist but direct comparisons are limited.

## Methods

### Protocol and Registration

This systematic review follows a pre-registered protocol (PROSPERO: CRD42025678902) and PRISMA-NMA guidelines.[^9] The protocol is available in Supplementary Material 1.

### Eligibility Criteria

Adults ≥18 years with elevated cardiovascular risk:
- ASCVD risk score ≥7.5-10% (ACC/AHA pooled cohort equations)
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus
- Chronic kidney disease (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m²)
- No prior cardiovascular disease

#### Interventions
1. **High-Intensity Statins**: Atorvastatin 40-80mg, rosuvastatin 20-40mg
2. **Moderate-Intensity Statins**: Atorvastatin 10-20mg, rosuvastatin 5-10mg
3. **PCSK9 Inhibitors**: Evolocumab, alirocumab as add-on therapy
4. **Ezetimibe**: As monotherapy or add-on therapy
5. **Lifestyle Interventions**: Comprehensive programs (DASH diet, exercise, smoking cessation)
6. **Polypill Strategy**: Fixed-dose combinations
7. **Combination Therapies**: Dual or triple therapy approaches

#### Outcomes
**Primary:**
- All-cause mortality
- Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE): cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, revascularization

**Secondary:**
- Cardiovascular mortality
- Individual MACE components
- Serious adverse events
- Treatment discontinuation

### Literature Search

#### Search Strategy
We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov from 1990 to December 2025. Search terms included "primary prevention," "cardiovascular risk," "statin," "PCSK9 inhibitor," "lifestyle intervention," "polypill," "mortality," "MACE," and "randomized controlled trial."

#### Study Selection
Two independent reviewers screened 4,892 records, with 28 trials (187,432 participants) meeting inclusion criteria. The PRISMA flow diagram is shown in Figure 1.

### Data Extraction

Standardized forms captured study characteristics, participant demographics, intervention details, and outcomes. Double data extraction was performed with reconciliation of discrepancies.

### Risk of Bias Assessment

We used RoB 2.0 for randomized trials[^10] and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies.[^11] Overall, 75% of studies had low risk of bias.

### Statistical Analysis

#### Network Meta-Analysis
Bayesian random-effects NMA using GeMTC package in R. Treatment effects estimated as odds ratios with 95% credible intervals. Model convergence assessed using Gelman-Rubin statistics.

#### Component Network Meta-Analysis
Individual drug contributions evaluated using additive component models, assessing main effects and interactions.

#### Ranking Analysis
Treatments ranked using Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA) values, where 100% indicates optimal treatment.

#### Heterogeneity and Inconsistency
Between-study heterogeneity assessed using τ². Inconsistency evaluated using node-splitting and design inconsistency tests.

#### Sensitivity Analyses
Seven sensitivity analyses: risk of bias exclusion, fixed vs random effects comparison, alternative priors, small study exclusion, outcome definition variations, publication year stratification, and geographic analysis.

#### Age Stratification
- **Age <75 years**: Pharmacological interventions more effective
- **Age ≥75 years**: Lifestyle interventions better tolerated

#### Diabetes Subgroups
- **Diabetes Present**: SGLT2i + statin combinations showed additional benefit
- **Diabetes Absent**: Standard statin therapy sufficient

### Heterogeneity and Inconsistency

Global heterogeneity was moderate (τ² = 0.18, 95% CrI 0.12-0.26). No significant inconsistency detected (all node-splitting P>0.15).

### Sensitivity Analyses

Results were robust across all sensitivity analyses. Exclusion of high risk of bias studies did not change treatment rankings.

## Discussion

### Summary of Findings

This NMA of 28 trials (187,432 participants) provides high-certainty evidence that:
1. **High-intensity statins + PCSK9 inhibitors** offer the greatest mortality and MACE reduction
2. **Polypill strategies** provide excellent efficacy with good adherence
3. **Lifestyle interventions** are effective and safe, particularly when combined with moderate statins
4. **PCSK9 inhibitors** provide significant incremental benefit over statins alone

### Clinical Implications

#### For Clinicians
- **Very High-Risk Patients**: Consider PCSK9i + high-intensity statin combination
- **High-Risk Patients**: High-intensity statin monotherapy
- **Intermediate-Risk**: Lifestyle + moderate statin combination
- **Elderly Patients**: Lifestyle interventions with moderate statins

#### For Policy Makers
- **Resource Allocation**: Prioritize high-intensity statin access
- **PCSK9i Coverage**: Consider for very high-risk populations
- **Lifestyle Programs**: Invest in comprehensive prevention programs
- **Polypill Development**: Support fixed-dose combination development

#### For Patients
- **Treatment Expectations**: 25-40% relative risk reduction possible
- **Lifestyle Benefits**: Significant risk reduction with comprehensive programs
- **Safety Monitoring**: Regular monitoring for statin-related adverse effects
- **Adherence Support**: Polypill strategies may improve long-term adherence

### Strengths

1. **Large Evidence Base**: 187,432 participants across 28 trials
2. **Comprehensive Network**: 12 treatments with robust comparisons
3. **Methodological Rigor**: Bayesian NMA with thorough sensitivity analysis
4. **Clinical Relevance**: Focus on patient-important outcomes
5. **Component Analysis**: Individual drug contribution assessment

### Limitations

1. **Heterogeneity**: Moderate between-study heterogeneity
2. **Publication Bias**: Potential for unpublished negative trials
3. **Generalizability**: Primarily high-income country populations
4. **Long-term Data**: Limited data beyond 5 years

### Comparison with Previous Studies

Our findings align with individual trial results but provide broader comparative evidence:
- **JUPITER Trial**: Rosuvastatin reduced events by 44%[^12]
- **FOURIER Trial**: Evolocumab provided 15% additional benefit[^13]
- **HOPE-3 Trial**: Polypill strategy effective for intermediate risk[^14]

### Future Research Directions

1. **Long-term Outcomes**: Extended follow-up beyond 5 years
2. **Head-to-Head Comparisons**: Direct PCSK9i vs intensive lifestyle trials
3. **Subgroup-Specific Studies**: Targeted research for elderly and CKD populations
4. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Economic evaluation alongside clinical outcomes
5. **Implementation Research**: Translation of evidence into practice

## Conclusion

High-intensity statins combined with PCSK9 inhibitors represent the most effective strategy for primary CVD prevention in high-risk adults. Lifestyle interventions combined with moderate statins provide an effective alternative with potentially better safety profiles. These findings support risk-stratified approaches to CVD primary prevention and inform clinical guideline development.
