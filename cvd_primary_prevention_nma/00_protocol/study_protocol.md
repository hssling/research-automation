## Abstract

**Background:** Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide, with significant opportunities for primary prevention in high-risk adults. Multiple pharmacological and lifestyle interventions are available, but optimal strategies remain unclear.

**Objectives:** To compare the effectiveness of different primary prevention strategies for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in adults at elevated cardiovascular risk.

**Methods:** We will conduct a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing:
- **Interventions**: Moderate/high-intensity statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, lifestyle interventions, polypills, and combination therapies
- **Population**: Adults with ASCVD risk ≥7.5-10%, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease
- **Outcomes**: All-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, and safety outcomes

**Analysis Plan:** Bayesian network meta-analysis with component analysis to assess individual drug contributions. Network meta-regression will evaluate effect modification by baseline LDL-C and absolute risk.

**Expected Impact:** This analysis will inform evidence-based guidelines for CVD primary prevention and support cost-effectiveness analyses.

## Background

### Rationale
Cardiovascular disease accounts for approximately 18.6 million deaths annually worldwide, representing 31% of global mortality.[^1] Primary prevention strategies targeting high-risk individuals can significantly reduce this burden. However, with multiple available interventions of varying efficacy and cost, optimal treatment strategies remain uncertain.

### Current Evidence Gaps
1. **Comparative Effectiveness**: Limited head-to-head comparisons between different prevention strategies
2. **Risk Stratification**: Uncertainty about optimal interventions for different risk levels
3. **Combination Therapies**: Limited evidence on additive benefits of combined interventions
4. **Long-term Outcomes**: Need for comprehensive mortality data across interventions

### Why Network Meta-Analysis?
Network meta-analysis (NMA) allows simultaneous comparison of multiple interventions by combining direct and indirect evidence, providing comprehensive treatment rankings and effect estimates.[^2]

## Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. To compare the effectiveness of different pharmacological and lifestyle interventions for primary prevention of all-cause mortality in high-risk adults
2. To compare the effectiveness of interventions for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)
3. To assess the safety profiles of different interventions

### Secondary Objectives
1. To evaluate effect modification by baseline risk factors (LDL-C, ASCVD risk score)
2. To assess individual drug contributions using component network meta-analysis
3. To evaluate cost-effectiveness implications through network meta-regression
4. To identify optimal treatment strategies for specific patient subgroups
