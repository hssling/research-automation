## **2. Title and Research Question**

### **2.1 Study Title**

**Tobacco Control Policies and Lung Cancer Mortality: A Global Ecological Study Assessing the Impact of WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Implementation (2005-2025)**

### **2.2 Research Question**

**Primary Question:**  
Do stricter national tobacco control scores (WHO FCTC MPOWER index) correlate with lower lung cancer mortality at the population level in the 181 WHO FCTC member states (2005-2025)?

**Secondary Questions:**  
1. What is the association between individual FCTC policy components (monitor, protect, offer, warn, enforce, raise) and lung cancer mortality reduction?
2. How does the association vary by country income level, geographic region, and baseline tobacco prevalence?
3. What is the population attributable fraction of lung cancer deaths attributable to tobacco use globally and regionally?
4. What are the healthcare cost savings and economic benefits associated with tobacco control policy implementation?

---

## **3. Objective**

### **3.1 Primary Objective**

To quantify the association between national implementation of WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) policies and lung cancer mortality rates across 181 member states from 2005 to 2025 using ecological study design.

### **3.2 Secondary Objectives**

1. To assess the effectiveness of individual FCTC policy components on lung cancer mortality reduction
2. To evaluate the dose-response relationship between FCTC implementation scores and mortality outcomes
3. To quantify healthcare cost savings and economic benefits of tobacco control policies
4. To identify optimal policy implementation sequencing for maximum lung cancer prevention impact
5. To project future lung cancer mortality under different FCTC implementation scenarios
