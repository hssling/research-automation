## Overall Assessment

- **Projects with High Agreement (â‰¥95%):** 8
- **Projects Requiring Review (<95%):** 1

## Recommendations

1. Review individual project reports for detailed discrepancy analysis
2. Projects with low agreement should involve senior reviewers for resolution
3. Consider updating data extraction protocols based on identified discrepancies
4. Projects with high agreement can proceed to meta-analysis or data synthesis
