# Protocol: Comparative Safety of Booster Vaccines (COVID-19, Influenza, HPV)

**Systematic Review Title:** Comparative Safety of Booster Vaccines (COVID-19, Influenza, HPV): A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Adverse Events Following Booster Doses Compared to Primary Vaccination

**Registration:** To be registered on PROSPERO
**Authors:** AI Research Automation System v2.5
**Date:** September 21, 2025

## Background and Rationale

Vaccination programs for COVID-19, influenza, and HPV have implemented extensive booster dose schedules to optimize protective immunity. While primary vaccination safety data is well-established, comparative safety profiles of booster doses versus primary doses across multiple vaccine types remain unclear.

Individual studies suggest boosters may increase local reactions but reduce serious adverse events. However, fragmented evidence across vaccines prevents comprehensive risk assessment. Post-COVID-19 vaccine campaigns and ongoing influenza/HPV programs necessitate evidence synthesis for booster safety strategies.

## Research Questions

**Primary Question:**
What is the pooled incidence of adverse events following booster vaccine doses compared to primary vaccination doses for COVID-19, influenza, and HPV vaccines?

**Secondary Questions:**
1. What is the comparative risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) between booster and primary doses?
2. How does safety profile vary by vaccine type (mRNA, viral vector, adjuvanted, viral)?
3. What is the dose-response relationship between number of booster doses and adverse events?
4. Does safety profile differ by population subgroups (age, sex, comorbidities)?

## Methods

### Eligibility Criteria

#### Population
- Recipients of COVID-19, influenza, or HPV vaccines
- Both primary and booster dose cohorts within studies
- Any age group, including vulnerable populations

#### Intervention
- Booster vaccine doses (dose ≥3 for COVID-19, ≥2 for influenza/HPV)
- Any booster formulation within same vaccine platform

#### Comparator
- Primary vaccination series (doses 1-2)
- Same vaccine type for head-to-head comparison

#### Outcomes
- **Primary:** Any adverse events within 7-42 days post-vaccination
- **Secondary:**
  - Serious adverse events (SAEs: hospitalization, life-threatening events)
  - Local reactions (pain, swelling, redness at injection site)
  - Systemic reactions (fever, fatigue, headache, myalgia)
  - Allergic reactions/anaphylaxis
  - COVID-19 vaccine-specific: myocarditis, pericarditis, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia
  - Rates of withdrawal/trial discontinuations due to adverse events

#### Study Designs
- Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
- Non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs)
- Prospective observational cohort studies
- Registry-based studies with concurrent controls
- Phase 3/4 clinical trials

#### Study Characteristics
- English language publications
- Minimum 100 participants per comparison group
- Reporting of adverse events through day 42 post-vaccination
- Primary data (vaccine registries, electronic health records)
- Booster doses defined per current WHO/CDC recommendations

### Search Strategy

#### Electronic Databases
- **Medical Literature:** PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library
- **Regulatory Sources:** ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO VigiBase, VAERS
- **Grey Literature:** WHO Technical Reports, CDC Vaccine Safety Publications

#### Search Themes
1. **Disease agents:** COVID-19, influenza, HPV, SARS-CoV-2
2. **Vaccine administration:** booster, additional dose, repeat vaccination
3. **Safety outcomes:** adverse event, side effect, safety, reactogenicity, tolerability
4. **Comparative terms:** versus, compared, versus primary, boost vs initial

### Study Selection Process

#### Screening Stages
1. **Title/abstract screening** by two reviewers using predetermined eligibility criteria
2. **Full-text screening** for detailed study assessment
3. **Data extraction** using standardized forms

#### Inter-Reviewer Agreement
- Kappa statistic calculated for initial screening round
- Discrepancies resolved by third reviewer
- Training conducted using 20 pilot articles

### Data Collection and Management

#### Data Extraction Form
- **Study characteristics:** First author, publication year, study design, duration
- **Population details:** Sample size per group, age range, sex distribution
- **Intervention details:** Vaccine type, formulation, booster timing, dosing schedule
- **Outcome measures:** Numerator/denominator for each adverse event category
- **Risk of bias assessment**

#### Data Management
- Excel spreadsheets for data entry
- Double data entry with reconciliation
- Comprehensive variable codebook maintained

### Risk of Bias Assessment

#### RCTs and NRCTs
- Cochrane ROB 2.0 tool for randomized trials
- ROBINS-I tool for non-randomized studies

#### Observational Studies
- GRADE framework for evidence quality assessment
- Sensitivity analyses for high-risk studies

### Statistical Analysis

#### Meta-Analysis Strategy
- Random-effects model (DerSimonian-Laird estimator)
- Risk ratios (RR) for binary outcomes with 95% confidence intervals
- Heterogeneity assessment using I² and τ² statistics

#### Subgroup Analyses
1. **By vaccine type:** COVID-19 vs influenza vs HPV
2. **By platform:** mRNA (Moderna/Pfizer) vs viral vector (J&J/AstraZeneca) vs adjuvanted (Novavax/GSK)
3. **By age group:** <18, 18-65, >65 years
4. **By booster number:** 3rd vs 4th vs 5th+ doses

#### Sensitivity Analyses
- One-study-removed analysis for influential studies
- Exclude high-risk-of-bias studies
- Subgroup excluding regulatory database reports

#### Reporting Bias Assessment
- Funnel plots for publication bias
- Egger's test for small-study effects
- Trim-and-fill analysis for asymmetry adjustment

### Evidence Synthesis

#### GRADE Approach
- Evidence certainty rated as High, Moderate, Low, Very Low
- Downgrade for risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision
- Evidence maps illustrated by outcome and subgroup

#### Network Meta-Analysis
- If sufficient direct and indirect comparisons available
- Bayesian or frequentist network analysis
- Surface under cumulative ranking (SUCRA) probabilities

### Dissemination Plan

#### Publications
- Main systematic review manuscript in high-impact journal
- Protocol publication in advance of results
- Supplementary materials with full data extraction

#### Translational Outputs
- Policy brief for WHO/Centers for Disease Control
- Risk-benefit calculators for healthcare providers
- Public communication materials for vaccine programs
