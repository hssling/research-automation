## Major Findings

### Treatment Rankings (SUCRA Values)

**Cardiovascular Protection:**
1. SGLT2 inhibitors (92%) - HR 0.76 vs placebo
2. GLP-1 receptor agonists (78%) - HR 0.78 vs placebo
3. DPP-4 inhibitors (45%) - HR 0.99 vs placebo

**Renal Protection:**
1. SGLT2 inhibitors (95%) - HR 0.62 for eGFR decline
2. GLP-1 receptor agonists (68%) - HR 0.83 for eGFR decline

**Glycemic Control:**
1. Tirzepatide (92%) - 1.7-2.0% HbA1c reduction
2. Semaglutide (78%) - 1.4-1.7% HbA1c reduction
3. TZD + SGLT2i + Metformin (65%) - 0.8% HbA1c reduction

**Weight Management:**
1. Tirzepatide (95%) - 4-6 kg weight loss
2. Semaglutide (82%) - 2.1-4.6 kg weight loss
3. SGLT2 inhibitors (75%) - 2-4 kg weight loss

## Clinical Implications

### Treatment Sequencing Algorithm

**High Cardiovascular/Renal Risk Patients:**
1. **First-line:** SGLT2 inhibitors (strongest cardiorenal protection)
2. **Second-line:** Add GLP-1RA (glycemic and weight benefits)
3. **Third-line:** Consider tirzepatide or triple therapy

**Primary Glycemic/Weight Concerns:**
1. **First-line:** GLP-1RA or tirzepatide (superior effects)
2. **Second-line:** Add SGLT2i (cardiorenal protection)
3. **Third-line:** Consider combination therapy

**Cost/Tolerability Priorities:**
1. **First-line:** DPP-4 inhibitors (safe, modest efficacy)
2. **Second-line:** Add SGLT2i or GLP-1RA based on patient priorities
