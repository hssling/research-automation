# ClinicalTrials.gov Search Access Limitation

## Issue Encountered
ClinicalTrials.gov's robots.txt file prohibits automated web scraping and fetching of search results:
```
Disallow: /search?
Disallow: /expert-search?
Crawl-delay: 1
```

## Impact on Research
This limitation affects our ability to:
- Automatically retrieve comprehensive trial listings
- Perform systematic searches across all relevant clinical trials
- Extract trial metadata programmatically
- Monitor ongoing trials for updates

## Alternative Approaches

### Manual Search Strategy
**Recommended ClinicalTrials.gov Search Parameters:**

1. **Basic Search Filters:**
   - Conditions: "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"
   - Interventions: SGLT2 OR GLP-1 OR DPP-4 OR pioglitazone OR insulin
   - Study Status: Active, Recruiting, Completed, Terminated

2. **Advanced Search URL Structure:**
   ```
   https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=Diabetes%20Mellitus%2C%20Type%202
   &term=SGLT2%20OR%20GLP-1%20OR%20DPP-4%20OR%20pioglitazone%20OR%20insulin
   &aggFilters=status:rec%20act%20ter%20com
   ```

3. **Study Type Filters:**
   - Interventional Studies (Clinical Trials)
   - Phase 2, Phase 3, Phase 4
   - Enrollment: â‰¥100 participants

### Manual Search Process
1. **Initial Search**: Execute search with above parameters
2. **Export Results**: Download CSV or XML format from ClinicalTrials.gov
3. **Deduplication**: Cross-reference with PubMed results
4. **Screening**: Apply same inclusion/exclusion criteria as PubMed studies
5. **Data Extraction**: Extract trial registration details, outcome measures, and status

### Key Trials to Look For
**Major Cardiovascular Outcome Trials (CVOTs):**
- EMPA-REG OUTCOME (empagliflozin)
- CANVAS/CREDENCE (canagliflozin)
- DECLARE-TIMI 58 (dapagliflozin)
- VERTIS CV (ertugliflozin)
- LEADER (liraglutide)
- SUSTAIN-6 (semaglutide)
- REWIND (dulaglutide)
- HARMONY (albiglutide)
- PIONEER 6 (oral semaglutide)

**Head-to-Head Comparison Trials:**
- CAROLINA (linagliptin vs glimepiride)
- GRADE (glimepiride, sitagliptin, liraglutide, insulin glargine)
- SUSTAIN trials (semaglutide vs other GLP-1RAs)
- PIONEER trials (oral semaglutide vs other agents)

### Data Elements to Extract
- NCT identifier
- Study title and acronym
- Phase and study type
- Enrollment numbers
- Primary and secondary outcomes
- Intervention details
- Study status and completion dates
- Results availability

### Integration with PubMed Results
1. **Cross-referencing**: Match ClinicalTrials.gov entries with published results in PubMed
2. **Status Updates**: Identify which registered trials have published results
3. **Unpublished Trials**: Flag important trials without published results
4. **Ongoing Trials**: Monitor for results as they become available

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Manual Search Execution**: Conduct manual search using provided parameters
2. **Results Integration**: Combine manual ClinicalTrials.gov results with PubMed findings
3. **Documentation**: Record all search parameters and export methods used

### Long-term Solutions
1. **API Access**: Apply for ClinicalTrials.gov API access if available for research purposes
2. **Alternative Sources**: Use ICTRP (WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform)
3. **Collaboration**: Partner with institutions that have API access
4. **Regular Updates**: Schedule monthly manual checks for new trial registrations

### Risk Mitigation
- **Publication Bias**: Ensure comprehensive capture of both positive and negative trials
- **Ongoing Trials**: Track important ongoing studies for future updates
- **Registry Quality**: Verify trial information accuracy through multiple sources

## Next Steps
1. Execute manual ClinicalTrials.gov search using provided parameters
2. Export results in CSV format for integration with existing database
3. Cross-reference with PubMed results to identify published vs ongoing trials
4. Update search strategy documentation with manual search findings
