# PROSPERO Registration: Childhood Obesity and Urbanization Trends - A Cross-National Ecological Analysis

**Registration Number**: CRD42018091674 (Updated: March 2025)

---

## **Review Title**
Association between urbanisation rates and childhood obesity prevalence across countries: A cross-national ecological study (2005-2025)

---

## **Purpose and Background**

### **Review System**
Childhood obesity has emerged as a global public health problem, with prevalence rates doubling since 1980. Urbanization, as a fundamental aspect of population change, may contribute to childhood obesity through alterations in physical environments, dietary patterns, and lifestyle behaviors. This review aims to investigate whether rapid urbanization is associated with higher childhood obesity prevalence, independent of GDP per capita, using ecological data from countries worldwide.

### **Key Issues**
- Urban environments are characterized by reduced physical activity opportunities, increased reliance on motorized transport, and proliferation of fast-food outlets
- Rural-to-urban migration in developing countries often leads to nutrition transition from traditional to energy-dense diets
- Built environments in cities may discourage active transportation and outdoor play for children
- Urban children have limited access to fresh food options due to higher-cost supermarket model

## **Review Objectives and Questions**

### **Primary Objective**
To determine if countries with more rapid urbanization show higher prevalence of childhood obesity, after adjusting for GDP per capita, using cross-national ecological data from 2005-2025.

### **Specific Review Questions**
1. What is the association between urbanization rate (percentage increase per year) and childhood obesity prevalence across countries?
2. Does this association persist after controlling for GDP per capita (log-transformed)?
3. Are there regional differences in the urbanization-obesity relationship?
4. Does the association differ by sex and age-group of children?

## **Eligibility Criteria**

### **Study Types**
- Cross-national ecological studies using country-level data
- Multi-country comparative studies with urbanization and obesity measures
- Longitudinal panel data studies examining country-level changes over time
- Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of ecological studies
- Quasi-experimental designs examining urbanization impacts

### **Participants**
- Children aged 5-17 years
- Data from one or more countries worldwide

- Countries with slow vs rapid urban growth

### **Outcomes**
- **Primary Outcome**: Prevalence of childhood obesity (BMI-for-age z-score > +2SD)
- **Secondary Outcomes**:

  - Mean BMI z-score
  - Changes in obesity prevalence over time

### **Data Sources**
- WHO Global Health Observatory
- UNICEF State of the World's Children reports
- United Nations World Urbanization Prospects
- World Bank indicators database
- Country-specific health and demographic surveys

### **Publication Status**
- Peer-reviewed publications

- International organization publications
- Conference abstracts will be included if complete data available

### **Language**
- English language publications
- International publications with English abstracts will be considered

### **Study Period**
- Studies published 2000-2025
- Data from 2005-2025 to capture recent urbanization trends

### **Exclusion Criteria**
- Single-country studies without cross-national comparison
- Individual-level studies (person-level regression)
- Small sample sizes (<1000 children per country)
- Ecologically unrelated urbanization exposures (e.g., urban planning without obesity outcomes)

## **Methods and Analysis**

### **Search Strategy**
Searches will be conducted in multiple electronic databases including:
- PubMed (MEDLINE)
- Embase
- Web of Science
- Scopus
- Global Health Library (WHO)
- ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global

### **Search Terms**
#### Population terms
- "child" OR "adolescent" OR "youth" OR "pediatric" OR "school-aged" OR "children"
- Combined with: "obesity" OR "overweight" OR "body mass index" OR "BMI"

#### Exposure terms
- "urbanization" OR "urban growth" OR "urban development"
- "urban sprawl" OR "urban expansion" OR "city growth"
- "metropolitan" OR "urban population" OR "urbanization rate"

#### Study design terms
- "ecological" OR "ecologic" OR "cross-national" OR "international comparison"
- "panel data" OR "panel study" OR "longitudinal"
- "geographic" OR "geographical" OR "spatial" OR "areal"

### **Manual Searching**
- Reference lists of included studies
- Citation tracking using Web of Science and Scopus
- Grey literature searches in WHO, UNICEF, World Bank databases

### **Data Collection Process**
Two reviewers will independently screen titles/abstracts and full texts for eligibility.

### **Data Extraction**
Standardized Excel forms will be used to extract:
- Study characteristics (year, country, period, sample size)
- Methodological features (study design, statistical methods, confounders)
- Exposure data (urbanization measure, units, data source)
- Outcome data (obesity prevalence, measure, age/sex groups)
- Confounder adjustment (GDP per capita, other socioeconomic factors)
- Effect estimates (coefficients, confidence intervals, p-values)

### **Quality Assessment**
Modified GRADE approach for ecological studies will evaluate:
- **Risk of bias** (exposure misclassification, confounder control)
- **Consistency** (heterogeneity across studies, I² statistic)
- **Directness** (relevance of outcomes, intervention comparability)
- **Precision** (narrow confidence intervals, adequate sample sizes)

### **Data Synthesis**
#### **Meta-Analysis Approach**
- Random effects model for pooling effect estimates
- Primary analysis: urbanization-obesity association without confounders
- Secondary analysis: adjusted for GDP per capita (log-transformed)
- Stratified analysis: by World Bank income level regions
- Sensitivity analysis: by study quality and publication year

#### **Statistical Methods**
- Standardized mean differences for prevalence outcomes
- Meta-regression for subgroup analyses
- Publication bias assessment (funnel plots, Egger's test)
- Heterogeneity quantification (I², Cochran's Q test)

### **GRADE Quality Assessment**
Each outcome will receive a GRADE rating (High/Moderate/Low/Very Low) based on risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.
