# Protocol: Childhood Obesity and Urbanization Trends - Cross-National Ecological Study (2005-2025)

## **Study Title**
Rapid Urbanization and Childhood Obesity: Global Patterns and Policy Implications (2005-2025)

---

## **1. Background and Rationale**

### **1.1 Public Health Crisis Context**
Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions worldwide, with over 340 million children underthe age of 18 experiencing overweight or obesity in 2020. The childhood obesity prevalence has multiplied by a factor of 2.5 since 1980, burdening healthcare systems with $254 billion in annual medical costs. Urbanization represents the most significant demographic transformation of the 21st century, with the urban population increasing from 50% to 68% of global population between 2005 and 2025.

### **1.2 Urbanization-Obesity Mechanisms**
Urban environments create obesogenic conditions through multiple pathways:

**Physical Activity Reduction:**
- Limited green spaces and recreational areas in high-density urban settings
- Reduced walking through safe pedestrian networks and public transport
- Sedentary lifestyles in overcrowded housing conditions
- Increased screen time and digital entertainment options

**Dietary Transitions:**
- Nutrition transition from traditional diets to processed, energy-dense foods
- Proliferation of fast-food outlets in urban neighborhoods
- Higher cost of fresh fruits and vegetables in urban markets
- Cultural shifts towards convenience eating with working parents

**Psychosocial Factors:**
- Increased stress associated with urban living
- Reduced family time and home-prepared meals
- Sleep deprivation from traffic noise and artificial lighting
- Social isolation in densely populated urban environments

### **1.3 Policy and Intervention Relevance**
As urbanization continues at unprecedented rates in developing countries, understanding the urbanization-obesity link is crucial for:
- Targeted public health interventions in rapidly urbanizing regions
- Urban planning policies that incorporate health considerations
- Designing preventive programs for high-risk urban populations
- International policy frameworks for addressing childhood obesity epidemics

## **2. Research Objectives**

### **2.1 Primary Objective**
To examine the association between rapid urbanization and childhood obesity prevalence across 150+ countries worldwide from 2005-2025, after adjusting for GDP per capita and other socioeconomic confounders.

### **2.2 Secondary Objectives**
1. **Regional Analysis**: Compare urbanization-obesity relationships across World Bank income groups and geographic regions
2. **Temporal Trends**: Assess how urbanization-obesity associations change over different time periods
3. **GDP Distinction**: Determine if urbanization remains associated with obesity after controlling for economic development (GDP per capita)
4. **Subpopulation Variations**: Identify differences by age (5-9 years vs 10-17 years) and sex

## **5. Statistical Analysis Plan**

### **5.1 Primary Statistical Model**

#### **Fixed Effects Regression Model**
```
Obesity_{it} = β₀ + β₁ × Urbanization_Rate_{it} + β₂ × Ln(GDP_Capita)_{it} +
                β₃ × Urbanization_Rate_{it} × Ln(GDP_Capita)_{it} +
                β₄ × Fertility_Rate_{it} + β₅ × Female_Literacy_{it} +
                α_i + δ_t + ε_{it}
```

Where:
- Obesity_{it} = childhood obesity prevalence in country i at time t
- Urbanization_Rate_{it} = annual urban population growth rate
- α_i = country-specific fixed effects (intercept terms)
- δ_t = year fixed effects capturing calendar year trends
- ε_{it} = residual error term with clustered standard errors

#### **Interaction Testing**
The model includes interaction terms between urbanization and GDP per capita to test whether the association differs by country income level.

### **5.2 Secondary Analyses**

#### **Regional Stratified Analysis**
```
Obesity_Region_{it} = β₀ + β₁ × Urbanization_Rate_{it} + Controls_{it} +
                      Regional_Dummies + δ_t + ε_{it}
```
Separate analyses for World Bank regions: High-income, Middle-income, Low-income countries.

#### **Temporal Analysis**
Piecewise regression to test threshold effects and nonlinear dose-response relationships.

### **5.3 Sensitivity Analyses**

#### **Alternative Exposure Definitions**
- Urban growth decadal vs annual measures
- Different urbanization rate thresholds (1%, 2%, 3% cutoffs)
- Urban population percentage changes vs growth rate

#### **Alternative Outcome Definitions**
- Obesity ≥95th percentile vs z-score > +2SD
- Age-specific prevalence rates (younger vs older children)
- Combined overweight + obesity prevalence

#### **Alternative Statistical Approaches**
- Random effects models for comparison with fixed effects
- Instrumental variables using historical urban policies as instruments
- Difference-in-differences using national urban policy implementations

### **5.4 Subgroup and Stratified Analyses**

#### **By Country Income Level**
- High-income vs upper-middle-income vs lower-middle-income vs low-income
- Separate analyses for countries below the income-obesity transition threshold

#### **By Geographic Region**
- Analysis stratified by WHO regions (Africa, Americas, Southeast Asia, etc.)
- Sub-analysis for urbanizing vs de-urbanizing countries

#### **Temporal Stratifications**
- Pre-COVID period (2005-2019) vs COVID period (2020-2025)
- Decadal analysis (2005-2015 vs 2016-2025)

### **5.5 Advanced Modeling Techniques**

#### **Nonlinear Modeling**
LOESS curves and restricted cubic splines will test for nonlinear urbanization-obesity relationships.

#### **Spatial Analysis**
Moran's I tests for spatial autocorrelation and geographically weighted regression for regional variations.

### **5.6 Power Calculations and Precision**

#### **Sample Size**
- **Total observations**: 150 countries × 20 years = 3,000 country-year pairs
- **Statistical power**: 95% power to detect 2.3% increase in obesity per SD urbanization rate
- **Adjustment factors**: Account for clustering by country and temporal autocorrelation

#### **Confidence Interval Width**
- Target CI width: ±1.8 percentage points for primary effect estimate
- Based on conservative intraclass correlation (ρ = 0.65) for panel data

## **6. Bias Assessment and Validity**

### **6.1 Ecological Fallacy Considerations**
- **Unadjusted analysis**: Likely underestimates individual-level effects
- **Adjustment strategy**: Include country-level confounders comprehensively
- **Validation plans**: Cross-reference with individual-level studies for triangulation

### **6.2 Measurement Error**
- **Urbanization measurement**: Use of UN population data (high reliability)
- **Obesity measurement**: WHO reference standards (gold standard)
- **GDP measurement**: IMF/WB national accounts (official statistics)

### **6.3 Confounder Control**
- **Comprehensive adjustment**: Include all theoretically relevant confounders
- **Residual confounding**: Sensitivity analysis with additional covariates
- **Functional form**: Test linearity and nonlinear relationships

### **6.4 Selection Bias**
- **Data availability**: More complete data from wealthier countries
- **Missing data**: Patterns by income level and region analyzed
- **Response**: Multiple imputation and sensitivity analyses
