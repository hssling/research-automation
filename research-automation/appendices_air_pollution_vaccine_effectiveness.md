## APPENDIX B: Risk of Bias Assessment Tool

### Adapted QUADAS-2 Framework for Pollution-Vaccine Studies

#### Questions for Bias Assessment

**Patient Selection:**
- Was the sample population representative of the target vaccinated population?
- Were there comparable baseline characteristics between pollution exposure groups?
- Were individuals sampled from regions with full pollution gradient coverage?
- Were there appropriate exclusions documented (pregnant, immunocompromised)?

**Pollution Exposure Assessment:**
- Were pollution measurements obtained from reliable data sources (government monitoring)?
- Did the exposure assignment account for spatial/temporal variations?
- Were individual-level exposure assignments preferred over area-level?
- Was pollution data validated against quality standards (European/Asian verification systems)?

**Vaccine Documentation:**
- Was vaccination status verified through multiple sources (registry + self-report)?
- Were vaccine types, manufacturers, lot numbers, and administration timing captured?
- Was vaccine documentation process independent of pollution exposure assessment?
- Were booster doses and series completion rates recorded?

**Outcome Assessment:**
- Were vaccine-preventable disease outcomes laboratory-confirmed?
- Was outcome assessment standardized across exposure groups?
- Were healthcare-seeking behaviors accounted for in outcome definitions?
- Was outcome ascertainment blinded to pollution exposure status?

**Confounding Adjustment:**
- Were demographic confounders (age, sex, socioeconomic status) addressed?
- Was clinical indication for vaccination controlled for?
- Were seasonal/temporal factors (vaccine timing, weather) adjusted?
- Were health behaviors (smoking, alcohol, diet) statistically controlled?

### Risk Category Definitions

**Low Risk:** Criterion clearly accomplished or low probability of bias affecting results
**High Risk:** Criterion not met or high probability of bias substantially affecting results
**Unclear Risk:** Insufficient information to determine risk level

### Quality Grading Algorithm

```r
calculate_quadas2_score <- function(selections, exposure, vaccine, outcome, confounding) {
  total_score <- 0
  risk_level <- "High Risk"

  # Scoring logic
  if(selections == "low" && exposure == "low") {
    total_score <- total_score + 2
  }
  if(vaccine == "low" && outcome == "low") {
    total_score <- total_score + 2
  }
  if(confounding == "low") {
    total_score <- total_score + 1
  }

  # Quality classification
  if(total_score >= 4) {
    risk_level <- "Low Risk"
  } else if(total_score >= 3) {
    risk_level <- "Unclear Risk"
  } else {
    risk_level <- "High Risk"
  }

  return(risk_level)
}
```

### Overall Quality Distribution Results

| Quality Level | Studies (n) | Percentage (%) | Included in Primary Analysis | Sensitivity Testing |
|--------------|------------|----------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| **High Quality (Low Bias Risk)** | 67 | 54.0% | ✅ Primary analysis | Reference group |
| **Moderate Quality (Some Uncertainty)** | 48 | 38.7% | ✅ Secondary analyses | Subgroup testing |
| **Low Quality (High Bias Risk)** | 9 | 7.3% | ❌ Excluded from pooled analysis | Separate qualitative synthesis |

## APPENDIX E: Mechanistic Pathways Framework

### Biological Mechanisms Linking Pollution to Vaccine Responses

1. **Particle Deposition and Mucosal Effects**
   ```
   PM2.5 particles deposit in respiratory tract
   └── Impaired mucociliary clearance
      └── Reduced antigen uptake by respiratory epithelium
         └── Decreased T-cell priming in regional lymph nodes
            └── Diminished vaccine-specific immune memory
   ```

2. **Oxidative Stress and Cellular Damage**
   ```
   Pollutant-derived reactive oxygen species
   └── Mitochondrial dysfunction in immune cells
      └── Reduced ATP production for proliferation
         └── Impaired lymphocyte expansion
            └── Dampened antibody production
   ```

3. **Cytokine Dysregulation**
   ```
   Pollution-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine release
   └── Altered T-helper cell polarization (Th2 shift)
      └── Reduced neutralizing antibody production
         └── Impaired viral neutralization
            └── Decreased vaccine effectiveness
   ```

4. **Genomic and Epigenetic Effects**
   ```
   Heavy metal components in particulate matter
   └── Oxidative DNA damage to immune genes
      └── Altered cytokine gene expression patterns
         └── Impaired immune regulation signaling
            └── Reduced vaccine response magnitude
   ```

## APPENDIX F: Quality Assessment Detailed Results

### Domain-Specific Bias Assessment by Study

| Study ID | Patient Selection | Pollution Exposure | Vaccine Documentation | Outcome Assessment | Confounding Control | Overall Risk | Inclusion Decision |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| SR_001 | Low Risk | Low Risk | Low Risk | Low Risk | Low Risk | Low Risk | Primary Analysis |
| SR_002 | Low Risk | Unclear Risk | Low Risk | Low Risk | Low Risk | Low Risk | Primary Analysis |
| SR_003 | Unclear Risk | Low Risk | Low Risk | Low Risk | Low Risk | Low Risk | Primary Analysis |
| SR_004 | Low Risk | Low Risk | Low Risk | Low Risk | Unclear Risk | Low Risk | Primary Analysis |

### Validation of Risk Classification

1. **High Quality Studies (n=67):**
   - Patient selection: 59/67 (88%) low risk
   - Exposure assessment: 60/67 (90%) low risk
   - Vaccine documentation: 62/67 (93%) low risk
   - Outcome assessment: 59/67 (88%) low risk
   - Confounding control: 56/67 (84%) low risk

2. **Moderate Quality Studies (n=48):**
   - Patient selection: 38/48 (79%) low risk
   - Exposure assessment: 36/48 (75%) low risk
   - Vaccine documentation: 40/48 (83%) low risk
   - Outcome assessment: 38/48 (79%) low risk
   - Confounding control: 35/48 (73%) low risk

3. **Low Quality Studies (n=9):**
   - Patient selection: 4/9 (44%) low risk
   - Exposure assessment: 5/9 (56%) low risk
   - Vaccine documentation: 6/9 (67%) low risk
   - Outcome assessment: 4/9 (44%) low risk
   - Confounding control: 5/9 (56%) low risk

### Rationale for Critical Domain Considerations

**Patient Selection:** Representative sampling from vaccinated populations across pollution gradients ensures generalizability of findings to real-world vaccination programs.

**Exposure Assessment:** Accurate quantification of pollution levels is critical since measurement error could substantially affect dose-response relationships.

**Vaccine Documentation:** Precise recording of vaccination timing, type, and completion status necessary for attributing outcomes to specific antigenic exposures.

**Outcome Assessment:** Laboratory confirmation of vaccine-preventable diseases provides objective, unbiased measures of protection effectiveness.

**Confounding Control:** Demographic, behavioral, and health-related variables must be adequately addressed to isolate pollution exposure effects.
