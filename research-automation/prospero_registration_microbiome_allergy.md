## **Section A: Title and Abstract**

### **Title**
**Microbiome-Allergy Associations and Taxa Identification: A Comprehensive Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis**

### **Abstract**
Allergic diseases affect approximately 30% of the global population, with increasing prevalence particularly in industrialized countries. The gut microbiome has emerged as a critical regulator of immune homeostasis and allergic sensitization through microbial-epithelial-immune crosstalk mechanisms. This systematic review and meta-analysis will comprehensively examine microbial signatures associated with allergic diseases, focusing on novel taxa identification and functional characterization across disease subtypes and developmental stages.
