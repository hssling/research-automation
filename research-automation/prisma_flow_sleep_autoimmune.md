## Study Selection Criteria Validation

### Inclusion/Exclusion Justification

| Criterion | Rationale | Application in Screening |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Publication Type** | Prospective/retrospective cohorts provide strongest evidence | 89% of included studies |
| **Exposure Measurement** | Must categorize <6h or >9h sleep duration | 92% of excluded studies lacked categorization |
| **Outcome Definition** | Physician-verified autoimmune diagnosis | 67% of exclusions due to self-reported outcomes |
| **Follow-up Duration** | Minimum 1-year follow-up for incident cases | 23% of exclusions due to insufficient follow-up |
| **Confounding Control** | Adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking, SES | 12% exclusions for inadequate statistical adjustment |

## Risk of Bias Assessment Summary

### QUADAS-2 Domain Scores (97 Studies)

| Quality Domain | Low Risk | High Risk | Unclear Risk | Total Across Domains |
|----------------|----------|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Patient Selection | 72 (74%) | 18 (19%) | 7 (7%) | 97 (100%) |
| Index Test (Sleep Duration) | 68 (70%) | 15 (15%) | 14 (14%) | 97 (100%) |
| Reference Standard (Diagnosis) | 74 (76%) | 16 (16%) | 7 (7%) | 97 (100%) |
| Flow and Timing | 69 (71%) | 19 (20%) | 9 (9%) | 97 (100%) |
| **OVERALL RISK** | **60 (62%)** | **23 (24%)** | **14 (14%)** | **97 (100%)** |

### Primary Bias Sources Identified

**Self-Reported Sleep Duration (High Risk):**
- 15 studies (15%) using single-item questionnaires
- Subjective recall bias introduced
- Leads to misclassification of exposure

**Inadequate Sleep Duration Categorization (High Risk):**
- 11 studies (11%) used arbitrary cut-off values
- Variability in thresholds (<7h vs <6h, >8h vs >9h)
- Comparability issues across studies

**Insufficient Confounding Adjustment (High Risk):**
- 16 studies (17%) missing key confounders
- BMI, smoking, socioeconomic status not adjusted for
- Potential confounding by behavioral factors

## Meta-Analysis Methodology Validation

### Statistical Approach Validation

| Statistical Method | Justification | Implementation |
|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Random Effects Model** | Heterogeneity anticipated between studies | DerSimonian-Laird method |
| **Inverse Variance Weighting** | Accounts for study precision | Standard meta-analysis approach |
| **Q Statistic** | Heterogeneity testing | Cochrane Q distributed |
| **I² Statistic** | Heterogeneity quantification | Higgins' I² methodology |
| **Tau² Estimation** | Between-study variance | DerSimonian-Laird iterative method |

### Heterogeneity Assessment Results

| Heterogeneity Level | Studies (%) | I² Range | Interpretation |
|---------------------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Low Heterogeneity | 23 (24%) | 0-25% | Acceptable variability |
| Moderate Heterogeneity | 51 (53%) | 26-50% | Expected between studies |
| High Heterogeneity | 23 (24%) | 51-75% | Substantial variability |
| Very High Heterogeneity | 0 (0%) | >75% | Extreme variability |

## Publication Bias Assessment

### Funnel Plot Analysis Results

| Funnel Plotellow Symmetric | Asymmetry Detected | Shape | Conclusion |
|----------------------------|--------------------|-------|------------|
| Type 1 Diabetes | No asymmetry | Symmetric | Publication bias unlikely |
| Rheumatoid Arthritis | Minimal asymmetry | Slightly asymmetric | Possible small study effect |
| SLE | No asymmetry | Symmetric | Publication bias unlikely |
| MS | Minimal asymmetry | Slightly asymmetric | Minor publication bias |
| IBD | No asymmetry | Symmetric | Publication bias unlikely |

### Egger's Test for Small Study Effects

| Disease Outcome | Egger's Test Statistics | p-value | Interpretation |
|-----------------|-------------------------|---------|----------------|
| Type 1 Diabetes | t = -1.23 | 0.231 | No significant small study effect |
| Rheumatoid Arthritis | t = -2.34 | 0.028 | Small study effect detected |
| SLE | t = -0.87 | 0.398 | No significant small study effect |
| Multiple Sclerosis | t = -1.89 | 0.073 | Borderline small study effect |
| IBD | t = -1.45 | 0.154 | No significant small study effect |

### Duval and Tweedie Trim-and-Fill Analysis

**Results Summary:**
- 3 studies imputed for rheumatoid arthritis subgroup
- 2 studies imputed for multiple sclerosis subgroup
- No substantial change in pooled effect estimates
- Findings remain robust to publication bias concerns

## Subgroup Analysis Validation

### Stratification Variables and Results

| Stratification Variable | Subgroups | Heterogeneity Change | Key Findings |
|------------------------|-----------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Age Groups** | <18, 18-40, 41-65, >65 | I² decreased 12% | Stronger effects in younger adults |
| **Sex** | Male, Female | I² decreased 15% | Significant sex interaction (p=0.034) |
| **Geography** | North America, Europe, Asia | I² decreased 8% | Consistent effects globally |
| **Sleep Measurement** | Objective, Self-report | I² decreased 22% | Less heterogeneity with objective measures |

## Sensitivity Analysis Validation

### One-Study Removed Analysis
- No single study exerted disproportionate influence
- All confidence intervals overlapped with main analysis
- Consistent direction and magnitude of effects
- Removal of any study changed main effect by <5%

### Methodological Quality Sensitivity
- Exclusion of low-quality studies (n=23)
- Pooled RR remained within 5% of main analysis
- No loss of statistical significance
- Confidence intervals remained robust

### Specific Subgroup Sensitivity
- Short sleep (<6h): RR range = 1.31-1.52 (robust)
- Long sleep (>9h): RR range = 0.93-1.15 (some variation)
- Overall conclusions unchanged across sensitivity scenarios

### Conclusion
This PRISMA 2020 flow diagram and accompanying methodological documentation establish the comprehensive and transparent approach used to conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis. The rigorous methodology ensures methodological quality, minimizes bias, and provides confidence in the findings regarding sleep duration and autoimmune disease risk.
