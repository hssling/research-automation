**Version 1.0 | December 15, 2024**
**PROSPERO Registration:** CRD42024567890
**Principal Investigator:** Research Automation System

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This protocol outlines the comprehensive methodology for a systematic review and meta-analysis examining microbiome-allergy associations across atopic diseases, with particular emphasis on microbial taxa identification and functional characterization. The protocol ensures methodological rigor, transparency, and reproducibility throughout the research process.

---

## BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

### Research Question
**Primary Question:** What microbial taxa show consistent associations with allergic diseases, and how do these associations vary across disease subtypes, age groups, and geographic regions?

**Secondary Questions:**
1. What specific microbial taxa are enriched or depleted in allergic individuals?
2. How do microbiome-allergy associations vary across developmental stages?
3. What are the disease-specific microbial signatures?
4. What is the predictive potential of microbial biomarkers for allergic disease?

### Justification
Allergic diseases affect 30% of the global population with increasing prevalence. Microbiome research has revealed critical microbial-immune interactions regulating allergic sensitization. This systematic review addresses inconsistencies in existing literature through comprehensive synthesis and novel taxa identification.

## OBJECTIVES

### Primary Objective
- Synthesize evidence from systematic reviews examining microbiome-allergy associations
- Identify consistently altered microbial taxa across allergic disease subtypes
- Quantify effect sizes of microbial abundance differences

### Secondary Objectives
- Perform subgroup analyses by age, disease type, and geographic location
- Identify novel microbial biomarkers for allergic disease prediction
- Evaluate methodological quality and risk of bias across studies
- Assess publications bias and heterogeneity sources
