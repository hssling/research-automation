## Section 3: Review Questions and Objective(s)

### Research Questions

**Primary Question:**
Does chronic exposure to ambient air pollution (PM₂.₅ particulate matter, NO₂ nitrogen dioxide, and O₃ ozone) reduce the effectiveness of routinely administered vaccines (e.g., influenza, COVID-19, pneumococcal, hepatitis B) in human populations, as measured by real-world clinical effectiveness against vaccine-preventable diseases?

**Secondary Questions:**
1. What are the quantitative effects of different air pollutants (PM₂.₅, NO₂, O₃) and pollution concentration bands on vaccine effectiveness across various vaccine types?
2. What are the dose-dependent relationships between air pollution exposure levels and vaccine effectiveness, including identification of threshold effects?
3. Which population subgroups show greatest vulnerability to air pollution-vaccine interactions (e.g., children, elderly, pregnant women)?
4. Are there specific vaccine types (live-attenuated, inactivated, mRNA, viral vector) that show differential susceptibility to air pollution exposure effects?

### Review Objectives

**Primary Objective:**
To synthesize evidence from epidemiological studies examining the impact of ambient air pollution on vaccine effectiveness in real-world settings, providing quantitative effect estimates for policy and clinical decision-making.

**Secondary Objectives:**
1. **Quantify Dose-Response Relationships:** Establish linear/logarithmic relationships between pollution exposure and vaccine effectiveness reduction
2. **Identify Vulnerable Populations:** Determine age groups, geographical regions, and socioeconomic subgroups at greatest risk
3. **Support Environmental Policy:** Provide evidence for air quality standards as indirect vaccine promotion strategy
4. **Guide Vaccination Strategy:** Inform timing of vaccinations and potential need for additional booster doses in polluted regions

### Rationale
Air pollution affects nearly 80% of the global population, with emerging evidence suggesting immune dysregulation affecting vaccine responses. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted urgent need for understanding environmental factors influencing vaccine effectiveness. No comprehensive systematic review exists synthesizing air pollution-vaccine interactions across real-world effectiveness studies.

**Public Health Impact:** Results will inform vaccination programs in polluted regions and support air quality regulatory decisions affecting millions of global vaccine recipients.

**Research Gap Addressed:** While laboratory studies suggest air pollution-immune interactions, systematic review of real-world vaccine effectiveness studies remains critically needed.

## Section 4: Study Eligibility Criteria

### Types of Study to be Included
**Study Design:** Prospective cohort studies, retrospective cohort studies, nested case-control studies, ecological studies with strong methodological rigor, and population-based vaccine effectiveness studies.

**Condition or Domain:** Chronic ambient air pollution exposure measured at individual or community level, with vaccine effectiveness as primary outcome.

**Intervention(s):**
- **Pollutants:** PM₂.₅ (particulate matter ≤2.5 microns), NO₂, O₃, traffic-related pollution, and multi-pollutant mixtures
- **Exposure Assessment:** Quantitative measurements from monitoring stations, satellite-derived estimates, land-use regression models, or validated exposure prediction models
- **Exposure Duration:** Minimum 24-hour acute exposure; preferably chronic long-term exposure (weeks to years)

**Comparator(s):**
- **Control Groups:** Same population vaccinated against same pathogens but with lower air pollution exposure
- **Within-Study Control:** Population-level comparisons during high vs. low pollution periods
- **Between-Study Control:** Vaccinated populations in clean air vs. polluted environments

**Outcome(s):**
**Primary Outcomes:**
- **Vaccine Effectiveness:** Relative risk (RR) or hazard ratio (HR) of vaccine-preventable disease in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated groups, across pollution exposure gradients
- **Effectiveness Range:** Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals comparing polluted vs. clean air environments
- **Clinical Verification:** Laboratory-confirmed disease outcomes requiring hospitalization, severe illness, or mortality

**Secondary Outcomes:**
- **Seroconversion Rates**: Antibody response magnitudes across pollution exposure levels
- **Immune Intercept Modification**: Altered vaccine response dynamics by exposure timing
- **Vaccine Strain-Specific Effects**: Differential responses to particular vaccine formulations
- **Indirect Community Effects**: Herd immunity dynamics affected by population-level pollution exposure

**Context(s):**
- **Environmental Context:** Urban vs. rural settings; WHO air quality guideline compliance
- **Climate Context:** Seasonal patterns affecting pollution formation and immune responses
- **Sociodemographic Context:** Low-income vs. high-income regions; minority populations disproportionately affected by pollution

**Population(s):**
- **General Population (Primary Focus):** All age groups receiving routinely administered vaccines
- **Vulnerable Subgroups:** Specific attention to children (<18 years), elderly (>65 years), pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals
- **Geographic Coverage:** Global representation with focus on highly polluted regions (East Asia, South Asia, Middle East, Latin America)

**Primary Exclusion Criteria:**
- Laboratory-based immunogenicity studies without real-world effectiveness outcomes
- Non-quantitative pollution exposure assessments (e.g., perceived pollution)
- Vaccine efficacy trials without environmental exposure components
- Studies lacking proper confounding adjustment (age, sex, socioeconomic status)
- Non-English publications (resource constraints)
- Studies on experimental vaccines without regulatory approval
