## **Section A: Title and Abstract**

### **Title**
**Sleep Duration and Risk of Autoimmune Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis**

### **Abstract**
Sleep is critical for immune regulation, yet observational evidence linking sleep duration to autoimmune disease risk requires systematic synthesis. This meta-analysis will examine whether short sleep duration (<6 hours) or long sleep duration (>9 hours) increase the risk of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis. Using cohort studies with at least 1-year follow-up, we will quantify dose-response relationships and evaluate methodological quality using established risk of bias criteria.

#### Risk of Bias and Quality Assessment

**QUADAS-2 Framework for Cohort Studies:**

|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Patient Selection** | Representativeness, consecutive enrollment, classification criteria clear | Low/High/Unclear |
| **Confounding Adjustment** | Key confounders accounted for, statistical adjustment appropriate | Low/High/Unclear |

#### Quality Grading System
- **High Quality:** Low risk of bias across all domains
- **Moderate Quality:** Uncertainty in no more than one domain
- **Low Quality:** High risk in one domain OR uncertainty in ≥2 domains

### **Data Synthesis**

#### Meta-Analysis Methods
**Primary Analysis Approach:**
- Random effects meta-analysis (DerSimonian-Laird method)
- Relative risk (RR) as primary effect measure
- Odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) converted to RR
- 95% confidence intervals for all effect estimates

**Dose-Response Meta-Analysis:**
- Restricted cubic splines for non-linear relationships
- Two-stage, generalized least squares method
- Piecewise linear model for segmented associations
- Optimal sleep duration identification

#### Heterogeneity Assessment
- Cochrane Q χ² test for heterogeneity significance
- I² statistic for heterogeneity quantification
- Tau² for between-study variance estimation
- Prediction intervals for individual study effects

#### Subgroup Analyses
```
PRE-SPECIFIED SUBGROUPS:
1. Autoimmune disease subtype (RA vs T1DM vs SLE vs MS)
2. Age categories (18-40 vs 41-65 vs >65 years)
3. Geographic region (North America/Europe vs Asia/South America)
4. Sleep duration extreme (>10 hours vs <5 hours)
5. Measurement method (self-report vs objective)
6. Study design (prospective vs retrospective)
7. Adjustment thoroughness (basic vs comprehensive)
```

#### Sensitivity Analyses
- One-study removed analysis
- Restricting to high-quality studies
- Including only large cohort studies (n > 5,000)
- Using alternative effect size measures (OR vs RR)
- Restriction to specific sleep thresholds
- Accounting for publication bias using trim-and-fill method

### **Reporting Bias Assessment**

#### Visual Assessment
- Funnel plots for small study effect detection
- Asymmetry testing using Begg's test
- Contour-enhanced funnel plots
- Influence plots for outlier studies

#### Statistical Tests
1. **Egger's Test:** Linear regression for small study effects
2. **Begg's Test:** Rank correlation of effect sizes
3. **Harbor's Test:** Absence of correlation verification

#### Investigation of Sources
- Subgroup analysis by study size (below/above median)
- Meta-regression of effect sizes on study size
- Restriction to studies with sample size > 10,000
