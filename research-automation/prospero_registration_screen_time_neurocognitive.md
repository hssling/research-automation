## **1. REVIEW TITLE**

**THE IMPACT OF DIGITAL SCREEN TIME ON NEUROCOGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT IN CHILDREN UNDER 12 YEARS: A COMPREHENSIVE META-ANALYSIS SYNTHESIZING GLOBAL EVIDENCE**

---

## **2. REVIEW OBJECTIVES**

### **Primary Objective**
To quantify the association between digital screen time exposure (duration, type, interactive vs. passive modalities) and neurocognitive outcomes (executive function, working memory, language development, attention regulation) in children aged 0-12 years.

### **Secondary Objectives**
1. To characterize dose-response associations between screen time duration and neurocognitive development
2. To differentiate effects of interactive versus passive screen modalities on cognitive outcomes
3. To assess differential impacts across developmental periods (infancy to pre-adolescence)
4. To generate evidence-based recommendations for pediatric screen use guidelines

---

## **3. BACKGROUND**

### **Rationale**
Children worldwide experience substantial digital media exposure, with average screen time exceeding 3-4 hours daily in developed nations and rapidly increasing in developing regions. Despite thousands of studies examining screen time impacts, evidence remains fragmented, yielding inconsistent findings that hinder development of evidence-based pediatric guidelines.

Recent studies suggest content-specific effects, where interactive educational content may enhance cognitive development while passive entertainment may detrimentally affect neurocognitive domains such as executive function, attention regulation, and working memory.

Previous systematic reviews suffer from methodological limitations including:
- Failure to distinguish content types (interactive vs. passive)
- Inadequate sampling of developmental periods
- Limited statistical power due to pooled analyses
- Absence of dose-response modeling
- Inconsistent outcome domain definitions

### **Rationale for Selection of Outcomes**
Neurocognitive outcomes selected based on developmental neuroscience evidence of sensitive periods and critical interdependence between domains:
- Executive function (emergence ages 2-6)
- Working memory (developmental peak ages 7-10)
- Language development (critical period birth-7 years)
- Attention regulation (foundation ages 0-5, consolidation ages 5-12)

### **Potential Impact of Findings**
- Inform WHO, AAP, and national pediatric screen use guidelines
- Guide parental education campaigns on healthy digital media practices
- Influence educational technology integration policies
- Direct future research through identification of key knowledge gaps
