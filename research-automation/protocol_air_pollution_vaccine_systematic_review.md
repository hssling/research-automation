# PROTOCOL: Air Pollution Impact on Vaccine Effectiveness

**Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis**

**PROSPERO Registration:** CRD42024567892
**Date:** December 12, 2025
**Version:** 2.0

---

## Background

### Rationale
Ambient air pollution exposure affects nearly 80% of the global population, with emerging evidence suggesting immune dysregulation impacting vaccine responses. While laboratory studies indicate air pollution-immune interactions, there is no comprehensive synthesis of real-world vaccine effectiveness studies. This protocol outlines a systematic approach to address this critical knowledge gap.

### Research Significance
- **Public Health Impact:** Pollution affects millions of vaccine recipients annually
- **Clinical Relevance:** Environmental factors influencing vaccination outcomes
- **Policy Implications:** Air quality standards as indirect vaccine promotion
- **Research Gap:** Missing systematic evidence on real-world pollution-vaccine interactions

## Research Questions

### Primary Question
Does chronic exposure to ambient air pollution (PM₂.₅, NO₂, O₃) reduce the effectiveness of routinely administered vaccines in human populations, as measured by real-world clinical effectiveness against vaccine-preventable diseases?

### Secondary Questions
1. What are the quantitative effects of different pollutants on vaccine effectiveness across pollutant concentration bands?
2. Are there dose-dependent relationships between pollution levels and vaccine effectiveness reductions?
3. Which population subgroups show greatest vulnerability to pollution-vaccine interactions?
4. What are the differential effects across vaccine types and technology platforms?

**Exposure Windows:**
- Pre-vaccination chronic exposure (≥6 months preferred)
- Post-vaccination exposure during outcome follow-up period
- Temporal pollution variations during study periods

### Types of Comparators
**Clean vs. Polluted Environments:**
- Low pollution exposure (<WHO guidelines vs. high pollution exposure (>WHO guidelines)
- Within-study direct comparisons (same population, different pollution periods)
- Between-study comparisons (clean vs. polluted geographical regions)
- Dose-response comparisons across pollutant concentration gradients

**Baseline Comparisons:**
- No pollution vs. minimal pollution exposure groups
- Reference pollution levels (<25 µg/m³ PM₂.₅) vs. higher exposure
- Pre-intervention vs. post-intervention pollution levels in quasi-experimental designs

### Types of Outcomes

#### Primary Outcomes

### Risk of Bias Assessment

#### Modified QUADAS-2 Framework
**Patient Selection Domain:**
- Was the study sample representative of the target population?
- Were there comparable pollution exposure groups?
- Were study participants drawn from appropriate pollution gradient regions?

**Pollution Exposure Domain:**
- Were pollution measurements accurate and properly assigned?
- Did exposure assessment methods minimize misclassification error?
- Were temporal and spatial exposure variations adequately captured?

**Vaccine Documentation Domain:**
- Was vaccination status reliably determined?
- Were vaccine timing and administration details captured?
- Was vaccine documentation independent of pollution exposure assessment?

**Outcome Assessment Domain:**
- Was disease outcome verification reproducible and unbiased?
- Were clinical outcomes appropriately confirmed (laboratory vs. clinical)?
- Was outcome assessment blinded to pollution exposure status?
- Were outcome measures standardized across exposure groups?

**Confounding Adjustment Domain:**
- Were key demographic confounders (age, sex, SES) adequately controlled?
- Were clinical confounders (comorbidities, health-seeking behavior) addressed?
- Was temporal confounding (seasonal illness patterns) appropriately handled?

#### Quality Rating Categories
**Low Risk:** All predefined domains adequately addressed with methodological rigor demonstrating reliability and validity of study findings.

**High Risk:** One or more critical evaluation domains seriously compromised, suggesting potential bias substantially affecting study validity and credibility.

**Unclear Risk:** Insufficient information prevents clear determination of bias risk level, creating uncertainty regarding study reliability and confidence in results.
