## **APPENDIX D: STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PROTOCOLS**

### **D.1 Meta-Analysis Framework**

#### **Primary Analysis Structure**
```R
# Load required packages
library(meta)
library(metafor)
library(dosresmeta)

# Primary meta-analysis function
perform_meta_analysis = function(data, outcome_group) {
  # Filter by outcome
  outcome_data = subset(data, primary_outcome == outcome_group)
  
  # Calculate effect sizes and variances
  effect_sizes = escalc(measure = "SMD", m1i = mean_exposed, 
                       sd1i = sd_exposed, n1i = n_exposed,
                       m2i = mean_control, sd2i = sd_control, 
                       n2i = n_control, data = outcome_data)
  
  # Random effects model
  meta_result = rma(method = "DL", yi = effect_sizes$yi, 
                   sei = effect_sizes$vi, data = outcome_data)
  
  return(meta_result)
}

# Heterogeneity assessment
calculate_heterogeneity = function(meta_result) {
  I2 = meta_result$I2
  tau2 = meta_result$tau2
  
  return(list(i_squared = I2, tau_squared = tau2))
}
```

#### **Publication Bias Assessment**
```R
# Egger's test for funnel plot asymmetry
egger_test = regress(stats$zi, sei, model = "lm")

# Begg's test for rank correlation
begg_test = ranktest(stats$zi, sei)

# Trim and fill analysis
trimfill_result = trimfill(stats)
```

#### **Dose-Response Meta-Analysis**
```R
# Fractional polynomial dose-response model
drm_model = dosresmeta(formula = y ~ rcs(dose, 3),
                      type = type, weights = weights,
                      se = se, cases = cases, n = n, 
                      data = dose.response.data)

# Restricted cubic splines for nonlinearity
rcs_splines = rcs(dose, 3)

# Bootstrap confidence intervals
bootstrap_ci = boot.function(drm_model, 1000)
```

### **D.2 Subgroup and Moderation Analysis**

#### **Subgroup Analysis Framework**
```R
# Age group moderator
age_moderator = update(meta_result, mods = ~ age_group, data = data)

# Content type moderator  
content_moderator = update(meta_result, mods = ~ content_type, data = data)

# Study quality moderator
quality_moderator = update(meta_result, mods = ~ quality_score, data = data)

# Meta-regression for continuous moderators
meta_regression = rma(yi = yi, sei = sei, mods = ~ moderator_variable, data = data)
```

### **D.3 Sensitivity Analyses**

```R
# Exclusion of low-quality studies
sensitivity_quality = subset(data, quality_score >= 8)  # Good quality threshold
high_quality_meta = rma(yi = yi, sei = sei, data = sensitivity_quality)

# Exclusion of outliers
sensitivity_influence = influence(meta_result)

# Leave-one-out analysis
leave_one_out = leave1out(meta_result)
```

### **D.4 GRADE Assessment Framework**

#### **Evidence Quality Domains**
- **Study Design:** RCTs start high, observational starts low
- **Risk of Bias:** Serious limitation deducts rating
- **Inconsistency:** High heterogeneity reduces quality
- **Indirectness:** Surrogate outcomes reduce quality
- **Imprecision:** Wide confidence intervals reduce quality
- **Publication Bias:** High bias risk reduces quality

#### **GRADE Levels**
- **High:** We are very confident effect lies close to true effect
- **Moderate:** We are moderately confident effect is close to true effect
- **Low:** Limited confidence, effect may be substantially different
- **Very Low:** Very little confidence, true effect likely substantially different
