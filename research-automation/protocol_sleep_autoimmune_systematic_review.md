## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This protocol outlines the comprehensive methodology for a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the association between sleep duration and autoimmune disease risk. The protocol ensures methodological rigor, transparency, and reproducibility throughout the research process, following international guidelines including PRISMA 2020 and MOOSE.

## BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

### Sleep Immunomodulation Hypothesis

Sleep represents a fundamental physiological process essential for immune homeostasis, immunological memory, and immune surveillance. The bidirectional relationship between sleep and immunity suggests that sleep disturbances may impair immune regulation and increase susceptibility to autoimmune disorders.

Sleep deficiency induces multiple immunological changes that could predispose to autoimmunity:
- Dysregulation of T-helper cell balance (Th1/Th2 imbalances)
- Reduced natural killer cell activity and tumor surveillance
- Altered cytokine production (increased pro-inflammatory cytokines)
- Changes in dendritic cell maturation and antigen presentation
- Modulated regulatory T-cell function

Despite promising mechanistic evidence and observational studies suggesting associations between short sleep duration and various autoimmune conditions, there exists no comprehensive systematic synthesis of the available literature.

### Study Rationale and Significance

**Epidemiologic Gap:**
While individual studies have demonstrated associations between sleep deprivation and autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus), findings are inconsistent and heterogeneous across populations and geographic regions.

**Clinical Relevance:**
Establishing sleep duration as a modifiable risk factor for autoimmune diseases could:
- Inform primary prevention strategies targeting 7-8 hours nightly sleep
- Guide clinical counseling for patients at risk of autoimmune diseases
- Inform public health policies addressing sleep health promotion
- Create novel therapeutic avenues for autoimmune disease management

**Research Significance:**
- First comprehensive meta-analysis incorporating prospective cohort data
- Dose-response analysis to identify optimal sleep duration targets
- Subgroup analyses across autoimmune disease subtypes and demographics
- Assessment of causality using established epidemiological criteria

---

## OBJECTIVES

### Primary Objective
- Systematically review observational evidence on sleep duration and autoimmune disease risk
- Perform quantitative meta-analysis to estimate relative risks across disease subtypes
- Identify dose-response relationships between sleep duration and disease incidence

### Secondary Objectives
- Conduct subgroup analyses by demographic factors (age, sex, geography)
- Evaluate methodological quality and risk of bias across included studies
- Assess publication bias and undertake sensitivity analyses
- Provide recommendations for clinical practice and future research

### Risk of Bias and Quality Assessment

#### Modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS)

| Domain | Assessment Items | Scoring |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| **Selection** | Representativeness, non-exposed cohort source, ascertainment, outcome | 0-4 points |

**High Quality:** NOS score ≥7 (low risk of bias)
**Moderate Quality:** NOS score 5-6 (moderate risk of bias)
**Low Quality:** NOS score <5 (high risk of bias)

### Data Synthesis

#### Meta-Analysis Methods
**Primary Effect Measure:**

- 95% confidence intervals for all estimates

**Model Specification:**
```
Random Effects Meta-Analysis:
- DerSimonian-Laird estimator for τ²
- Confidence intervals using Knapp-Hartung adjustment
- Heterogeneity quantification (I², τ²)
- Prediction intervals for future studies
```

**Dose-Response Meta-Analysis:**
- Restricted cubic splines for non-linear relationships
- Generalized least squares regressions
- Identification of J-shaped dose-response curve
- Optimal sleep duration determination

#### Heterogeneity Assessment
**Statistical Measures:**
- Cochran Q test (p < 0.10 indicates heterogeneity)
- Higgins I² statistic (thresholds: <40% = low, 40-60% = moderate, >60% = high)
- Prediction intervals to assess generalizability

**Subgroup Examinations:**
```
Pre-specified Subgroups for Heterogeneity Exploration:
1. Sleep duration extreme (<5h vs >10h vs 5-10h)
2. Autoimmune disease subtype (specific vs systemic diseases)
3. Age strata (18-40, 41-65, >65 years)
4. Geographic region (North America/Europe vs Asia)
5. Study design (prospective vs retrospective)
6. Sleep measurement method (self-report vs objective)
7. Confounding adjustment level (basic vs comprehensive)
8. Study quality (high vs moderate vs low NOS score)
```

#### Sensitivity Analyses
**Methodological Robustness Testing:**
- One study removed analysis to identify influential studies
- Restricting analysis to high-quality studies (NOS ≥7)
- Including only studies with large sample sizes (n > 50,000)
- Using different effect size measures (RR vs OR)
- Various sleep duration thresholds (<6h vs <7h)
- Subgroup analyses restricted to specific populations
