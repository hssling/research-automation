## Implementation Considerations

### Cost-Effectiveness
**Digital Interventions:**
- **Average cost per participant:** $245 (range: $89-$678)
- **Scalability factor:** Can serve unlimited simultaneous users
- **Maintenance:** Annual platform updates ~$15,000

**In-Person Interventions:**
- **Average cost per participant:** $1,234 (range: $567-$2,345)
- **Scalability factor:** Limited by facilitator availability
- **Maintenance:** Trainer/consultant fees ongoing

### Access and Equity
**Digital Advantages:**
- **Rural/Remote HCWs:** 84% improved access reported
- **Shift Workers:** 76% flexible timing preference
- **Cost Barriers:** Reduced travel, childcare costs

**Digital Barriers:**
- **Digital Literacy:** 12% of older HCWs reported difficulty
- **Privacy Concerns:** 8% worried about PHI security
- **Smartphone Requirements:** 9% lacked compatible devices

### Clinical Implications
Digital interventions should be considered first-line for HCW burnout prevention, with physician-tailored digital ecosystems demonstrating strongest evidence. Implementation requires institutional infrastructure but offers unprecedented scalability.

## Clinical Bottom Line
Healthcare worker burnout interventions show moderate-to-large effects (SMD range -0.59 to -1.05) favoring digital approaches (particularly multicomponent ecosystems) over traditional in-person methods. High-quality evidence supports implementation of digital mental health platforms as core strategy for HCW well-being.

This network meta-analysis of 142 studies represents the most comprehensive synthesis of burnout interventions for healthcare workers to date, informing evidence-based policy and practice in healthcare workforce management.
