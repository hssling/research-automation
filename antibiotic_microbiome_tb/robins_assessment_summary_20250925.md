## IMPLICATIONS FOR META-ANALYSIS
- **Overall Confidence**: Studies demonstrate moderate methodological quality
- **Heterogeneity Consideration**: Risk of bias differences may contribute to statistical heterogeneity
- **Sensitivity Analyses**: Recommended to explore impact of study quality on meta-analysis results

## RECOMMENDATIONS
1. **Subgroup Analysis**: Consider stratifying meta-analyses by overall risk of bias
2. **Sensitivity Testing**: Re-run analyses excluding high-risk studies
3. **Quality Reporting**: Use ROBINS-I results in systematic review discussion and limitations sections

**Assessment Tool**: ROBINS-I v1.0 framework
**Quality Assurance**: Automated structured assessment with domain-specific criteria
**Publication Value**: Comprehensive bias assessment enables transparent evidence synthesis
