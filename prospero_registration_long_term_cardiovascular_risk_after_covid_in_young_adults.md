## Registration Details
**Systematic Review Title:** Long-Term Cardiovascular Risk After COVID-19 in Young Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

**Protocol Stage:** Version 1.0 (October 2025)

**Review Question:** What is the pooled risk of cardiovascular outcomes (myocarditis, arrhythmia, thromboembolism) among young adults (<40 years) with prior COVID-19 infection compared to controls?

## Review Registration Form

**Source of Funding:** None declared (academic exercise)
**Conflicts of Interest:** None declared

### 2. Detailed Review Question
- **Participants:** Young adults aged 18-39 years with confirmed history of COVID-19 infection
- **Intervention/Exposure:** SARS-CoV-2 infection (any variant, any severity)
- **Comparator:** Young adults without history of COVID-19 infection (controls)
- **Outcomes:** Primary cardiovascular outcomes including myocarditis, cardiac arrhythmias, and thromboembolic events
- **Study Types:** Cohort studies, population-based registries, case-control studies

### 3. Objective
To quantitatively synthesize the evidence on long-term cardiovascular complications following COVID-19 in young adults, providing pooled risk estimates to inform clinical screening and preventive strategies.

### 4. Selection Criteria and Eligibility

#### 4.1 Types of study to be included
- **Design:** Cohort studies (prospective/retrospective), population-based registries, nested case-control studies
- **Participants:** Adults aged 18-39 years at time of COVID-19 diagnosis (or equivalent)

#### 4.2 Condition or domain being studied
- Cardiovascular complications following COVID-19 infection
- Focus: Long-term outcomes (≥3 months post-infection)

#### 4.3 Intervention(s), exposure(s)
- SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR, antigen testing, or serology
- Any COVID-19 variant or severity level

#### 4.4 Comparator(s)
- Age- and sex-matched controls without confirmed COVID-19 infection
- Non-COVID-19 period comparators where appropriate

#### 4.5 Dentalator Outcome(s)
- **Primary:** Myocarditis, cardiac arrhythmias (AF/atrial flutter, VT/VF, etc.), thromboembolic events (DVT, PE, stroke)
- **Secondary:** Composite cardiovascular outcomes, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalizations

#### 4.6 Duration of follow-up
- Minimum 3 months post-COVID-19 diagnosis
- Preferred: ≥6 months

### 5. Search Strategy

#### 5.1 Search Strategy Databases

- EMBASE
- Cochrane Library
- Web of Science
- Scopus
- ClinicalTrials.gov
- Google Scholar

#### 5.2 Search Strategy Keywords and Synonyms

### 6. Data Extraction and Synthesis

#### 6.1 Method for selecting studies
- Dual independent screening (title/abstract, full-text)
- Resolution of disagreements by third reviewer

#### 6.2 Data extraction method
- Pre-piloted extraction forms
- Dual independent extraction
- Standard data items: study characteristics, participant demographics, COVID-19 details, outcome measures, risk estimates (RR, OR, HR)

#### 6.3 Risk of bias assessment
- Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies
- Cochrane RoB 2 tool (supplemental)

#### 6.4 Strategy for data synthesis
- Random-effects meta-analysis using inverse variance weighting method
- Pooled risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals
- Assessment of publication bias (funnel plots, Egger's test)

#### 6.5 Heterogeneity incorporation
- I² statistic and χ² test for heterogeneity assessment
- Meta-regression for exploration of heterogeneity sources
- Subgroup analyses by COVID-19 severity, follow-up duration, study design

### 7. Analysis Heterogeneity

#### 7.1 Measure of Consistency
- I² statistic (0% to 40%: not important; 40% to 60%: moderate; 60% to 75%: substantial; 75% to 100%: considerable)
- Cochran's Q test

#### 7.2 Description of any planned subgroup and sensitivity analyses
- Subgroup by follow-up duration (0-6, 6-12, >12 months)
- COVID-19 severity (mild, moderate, severe)
- Study quality (NOS score)
- Geographic region (if sufficient data)

#### Statistical Analysis
- Random-effects model (DerSimonian-Laird)
- Meta-regression for continuous covariates
- Sensitivity analyses excluding studies at high risk of bias

### 8. Overall Plan for Reporting the Review
