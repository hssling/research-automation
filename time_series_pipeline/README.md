# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting Pipeline

A comprehensive automated pipeline that combines statistical forecasting (ARIMA/Prophet) and machine learning (LSTM) for time series analysis. Just plug in your dataset and get automatic analysis + predictions.

## Features

- **Prophet Forecasting**: Bayesian time series model with trend, seasonality, and holiday effects
- **ARIMA Forecasting**: Classical statistical time series methodology
- **LSTM Neural Network**: Deep learning approach for complex pattern recognition
- **Automated Visualization**: Generates forecast plots and model comparison
- **Performance Metrics**: MSE, RMSE, MAE comparison across models
- **Publication-Ready Reports**: Automatic Word (.docx) and PDF reports with all plots and interpretations
- **Excel Export**: Detailed forecasts with confidence intervals and model comparison table
- **Individual Model CSVs**: Separate CSV exports for each model's predictions (Prophet/ARIMA/LSTM)
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Web-based visualization dashboard with model comparisons and export options

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment

```bash
# Navigate to the pipeline directory
cd time_series_pipeline

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Prepare Your Data

Place your time series data in `data/timeseries.csv` with columns:
- `ds` â†’ dates (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `y` â†’ values to predict

Example:
```csv
ds,y
2024-01-01,100.5
2024-01-02,105.2
2024-01-03,98.7
...
```

### 3. Run the Pipeline

```bash
python pipeline.py
```

## Output

The pipeline generates comprehensive outputs for complete analysis:

## Model Details

### Prophet
- Handles trend, seasonality, holidays
- Robust to missing data and outliers
- Forecasts 90 days into the future

### ARIMA
- Classical statistical approach
- Uses last 30 points for testing
- Order: (5,1,0) - 5 autoregressive terms, 1 differencing, 0 moving average

### LSTM
- Deep learning neural network
- 5-day look-back window
- 50 LSTM units, trained for 20 epochs
- Uses 80/20 train/test split

## Customization

### Modify Forecast Horizonts
```python
# In pipeline.py
future = prophet_model.make_future_dataframe(periods=30)  # Change forecast period
```

### Adjust LSTM Parameters
```python
# In pipeline.py
look_back = 10  # Increase look-back window
model = Sequential([LSTM(100, ...), ...])  # More units
model.fit(..., epochs=50, ...)  # More training
```

### Tune ARIMA Order
```python
# In pipeline.py
arima_model = ARIMA(train, order=(2,1,2))  # Adjust p,d,q parameters
```
