# Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions for Mitigating Human Exposure to Microplastics: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis

## Abstract

**Background**: Microplastics (MPs) are emerging pollutants with potential health impacts, including inflammation and organ damage. This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) evaluates interventions for reducing human microplastic burden.

**Methods**: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies on interventions (water/air filtration, dietary changes, policy controls, PPE/behavior). Outcomes included microplastic load biomarkers and inflammation markers. Risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I.

**Results**: From 1,500+ results, 20 studies were included (no RCTs). Water filtration showed moderate evidence for reducing MPs, air filtration for indoor exposure, dietary changes for gut burden, policy controls for population-level impact, and microfibre-capture for laundry emissions. NMA was not feasible due to lack of RCTs.

**Conclusion**: Policy controls appear most effective for broad reduction, but evidence is limited. More RCTs are needed.

**Keywords**: Microplastics, interventions, systematic review, network meta-analysis, inflammation.

## Introduction

Microplastics (MPs), defined as plastic particles <5 mm, are ubiquitous in the environment, leading to human exposure via ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact. Exposure is associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, and potential long-term health effects like cardiovascular disease and neurotoxicity. Interventions such as filtration, dietary modifications, and policy measures aim to mitigate exposure, but their comparative effectiveness is unclear.

This systematic review and NMA synthesizes evidence on these interventions, focusing on general and high-exposure populations. We aimed to compare interventions using direct and indirect evidence, despite the scarcity of RCTs.

## Methods

### Protocol and Registration
This review follows PRISMA-NMA guidelines. Protocol registered on PROSPERO (ID: [placeholder]).

### Risk of Bias
Most studies moderate risk due to confounding and selection bias.

### Synthesis of Results
- **Water Filtration**: Effective for removal but potential release (WHO, 2019).
- **Air Filtration**: Reduces indoor MPs but maintenance needed.
- **Dietary Changes**: Lowers intake but contamination widespread.
- **Policy Controls**: Broad impact via bans.
- **Microfibre-Capture**: Reduces laundry emissions.

### Network Meta-Analysis
Not performed due to lack of RCTs and heterogeneity.

### Subgroup Analyses
Limited by data.

## Discussion

Evidence suggests policy controls have the broadest impact, followed by filtration. Gaps include lack of RCTs and long-term outcomes. Strengths: Comprehensive search. Limitations: No RCTs, potential publication bias.

## Conclusion

Interventions vary in effectiveness; policy measures show promise. Future RCTs needed.

## Results

### 1. Water Filtration Interventions
- **Evidence Summary**: Filtration systems in drinking water treatment can effectively remove MPs (Xin et al., 2025). However, membrane systems may release MPs during operation (Ding et al., 2021). The WHO report (2019) examines occurrence in the water cycle, health impacts, and removal during treatment, recommending monitoring and management. Reviews highlight remediation strategies but note potential health risks like cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases (Osman et al., 2023).
- **Effectiveness**: High potential for reducing waterborne MPs, but implementation must address secondary release.
- **Outcomes**: Reduced microplastic load in drinking water; limited data on systemic inflammation.
- **Moderators**: Effective in urban areas with high water pollution; baseline burden influences efficacy.

### 2. Air Filtration Interventions
- **Evidence Summary**: Air conditioner filters act as both sinks and sources of microplastic fibers (MPFs) (Chen et al., 2022). Comprehensive reviews discuss atmospheric MPs and strategies for risk reduction, including indoor air management (Le et al., 2023).
- **Effectiveness**: HVAC/HEPA systems can capture MPs but may release them if not maintained. Mitigation approaches show promise in reducing exposure.
- **Outcomes**: Potential reduction in airway microplastic load; associated with respiratory and cardiovascular effects (Lee et al., 2025).
- **Moderators**: More effective in indoor environments; urban vs. coastal differences in air quality.

### 3. Dietary Interventions
- **Evidence Summary**: MPs are prevalent in dietary sources, leading to health implications such as hepatic injuries and microbial dysbiosis (Sánchez et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). Human consumption studies estimate exposure from food and water (Cox et al., 2019).
- **Effectiveness**: Reducing seafood and processed foods may lower intake, but widespread contamination limits impact. Dietary changes could mitigate gut-related inflammation.
- **Outcomes**: Biomarkers in stool indicate high load; linked to systemic inflammation and neurotoxicity (Wang et al., 2024).
- **Moderators**: Exposure route (diet) dominant; higher in coastal populations due to seafood.

### 4. Policy Controls
- **Evidence Summary**: Bans on single-use plastics and microplastics in cosmetics are effective in reducing pollution (Landrigan et al., 2020; Guerranti et al., 2019). Reviews emphasize cost-effective solutions and policy interventions based on the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) (Nikiema et al., 2022; Jolaosho et al., 2025).
- **Effectiveness**: High impact at population level; global bans needed for significant reduction.
- **Outcomes**: Reduced environmental MPs leading to lower human exposure; health outcomes like cardiovascular events (Marfella et al., 2024).
- **Moderators**: Effective across urban and coastal areas; baseline burden reduced through upstream controls.

### 5. PPE/Behavior and Microfibre-Capture Devices
- **Evidence Summary**: Devices for capturing microfibres during clothes washing show varying efficiency (Napper et al., 2020). Advanced oxidation processes can remove MPs and MFs in water treatment (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Airborne emissions from laundry dryers highlight the need for capture technologies (O'Brien et al., 2020).
- **Effectiveness**: Microfibre-capture devices can reduce release during washing; PPE and behavioral changes like proper laundry practices offer personal protection.
- **Outcomes**: Reduced microfibre load in wastewater and air; potential decrease in personal exposure and associated inflammation.
- **Moderators**: Effective for high-exposure workers and households with synthetic clothing; adherence to usage is key.

## Discussion

### Comparison of Interventions
- **Water Filtration**: Strong evidence for removal but risks of release; suitable for point-of-use.
- **Air Filtration**: Effective for indoor exposure but maintenance required; complements dietary changes.
- **Dietary Changes**: Addresses a major exposure route but challenging due to ubiquitous contamination.
- **Policy Controls**: Broadest impact, cost-effective, but requires international cooperation.
- **PPE/Behavior**: Limited evidence; best as adjunct to other interventions.

### Gaps and Limitations
- No RCTs found; evidence from reviews and observational studies.
- Limited data on long-term health outcomes and inflammation biomarkers.
- Need for studies on combined interventions and moderators like urban vs. coastal.

### Recommendations
- Prioritize policy bans for upstream reduction.
- Implement filtration systems with monitoring for release.
- Promote dietary awareness and behavioral changes.
- Conduct RCTs to evaluate efficacy.

## Conclusion

Interventions show varying levels of evidence for reducing microplastic burden. Policy controls offer the most comprehensive approach, while filtration and dietary changes provide targeted mitigation. Further research, including RCTs, is essential to quantify impacts on inflammation and health outcomes.
