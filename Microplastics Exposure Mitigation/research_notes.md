## WHO Report on Microplastics in Drinking-Water (2019)
- Source: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241516198
- Overview: Critically examines evidence on occurrence of microplastics in the water cycle (tap and bottled water), potential health impacts from exposure, and removal during wastewater and drinking-water treatment.
- Key Findings: Raises concerns about impact on human health; recommends monitoring and management of microplastics in the environment; identifies knowledge gaps for better assessment of health risks.
- Relevance: Supports water filtration interventions; notes need for more research on health effects and effective removal strategies.

## Next Steps
- Fetch more specific searches (e.g., air filtration, dietary changes, policy interventions).
- Attempt to find WHO reports or other grey literature.
- Collect data on RCTs and trials for specific interventions.
- Analyze collected data for comparisons.
