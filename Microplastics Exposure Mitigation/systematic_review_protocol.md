# Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis Protocol: Interventions for Reducing Human Microplastic Burden and Inflammation

## Title
Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions for Mitigating Human Exposure to Microplastics: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis

## Background
Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous environmental pollutants with potential adverse health effects, including inflammation and organ damage. Human exposure occurs via air, water, diet, and other routes. Various interventions aim to reduce exposure, but their comparative effectiveness is unclear. This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) will evaluate the efficacy of interventions in reducing microplastic burden and associated inflammation.

## Objectives
1. To systematically review and synthesize evidence on interventions for reducing human microplastic exposure and burden.
2. To perform a network meta-analysis to compare the relative effectiveness of different interventions.
3. To assess the impact on biomarkers of microplastic load and systemic inflammation.

## Methods

### Eligibility Criteria
- **Population**: General population and high-exposure workers (e.g., coastal communities, industrial workers).
- **Interventions**: Water filtration (point-of-use filters), air filtration (HVAC/HEPA), dietary changes (seafood reduction), microfibre-capture devices, policy controls (bans), PPE/behavior modifications.
- **Comparators**: Usual care, placebo, or other interventions.
- **Outcomes**:
  - Primary: Biomarkers of microplastic load (e.g., in stool, airway, blood).
  - Secondary: Systemic inflammation markers (e.g., CRP, cytokines), health outcomes (e.g., cardiovascular events, neurotoxicity).
- **Study Design**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, quasi-experimental studies, controlled before-after studies. Observational studies if no RCTs available.
- **Publication Date**: 2010 onwards.
- **Language**: English.

### Information Sources
- Electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus.
- Grey literature: WHO reports, government websites, conference abstracts.
- Additional sources: Reference lists of included studies, expert consultations.

### Search Strategy
- Keywords: microplastics, nanoplastics, exposure, mitigation, interventions, filtration, dietary, policy, PPE, inflammation, biomarkers.
- Boolean operators: (microplastics OR nanoplastics) AND (exposure OR burden) AND (mitigation OR intervention OR filtration OR dietary OR policy OR PPE) AND (human OR population) AND (inflammation OR biomarkers OR health outcomes).
- Filters: Human studies, English language.

### Study Selection
- Two independent reviewers will screen titles/abstracts, then full texts.
- Discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer.
- Data extraction using standardized forms (e.g., Covidence or Excel).

### Data Extraction
- Study characteristics: Design, population, intervention details, outcomes, follow-up.
- Outcomes: Means, SDs, effect sizes for continuous outcomes; ORs/RRs for binary.
- Risk of bias: Using ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies or RoB 2 for RCTs.

### Risk of Bias Assessment
- Assess selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias.
- Overall risk: Low, moderate, high.

### Data Synthesis
- Narrative synthesis for qualitative data.
- Meta-analysis if sufficient homogeneous studies (random-effects model).
- Network meta-analysis: Bayesian or frequentist framework to compare interventions indirectly.
- Subgroup analyses: By exposure route, population type.
- Sensitivity analyses: Exclude high-risk bias studies.

### Assessment of Heterogeneity
- IÂ² statistic; explore sources (e.g., study design, population).

### Publication Bias
- Funnel plots, Egger's test.

### Confidence in Evidence
- GRADE approach for NMA.

## Timeline
- Protocol registration: PROSPERO (if applicable).
- Search and screening: 1-2 weeks.
- Data extraction and analysis: 2-3 weeks.
