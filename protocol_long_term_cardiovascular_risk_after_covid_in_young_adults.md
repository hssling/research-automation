# Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocol: Long-Term Cardiovascular Risk After COVID-19 in Young Adults

## Title
Long-Term Cardiovascular Risk After COVID-19 in Young Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

## Background
COVID-19 has revealed potential cardiovascular complications beyond the acute phase. While initial concerns focused on elderly populations, emerging evidence suggests that young adults (<40 years) may also be at risk for long-term cardiovascular outcomes including myocarditis, arrhythmias, and thromboembolic events. Existing cohort studies provide scattered evidence, but a systematic synthesis could inform screening and prevention strategies for this previously low-risk population.

This meta-analysis will pool risk estimates from cohort studies comparing cardiovascular outcomes in young adults with prior COVID-19 infection versus controls without infection.

## Research Question
What is the pooled risk of cardiovascular outcomes (myocarditis, arrhythmia, thromboembolism) among young adults (<40 years) with prior COVID-19 infection compared to controls?

## Objectives
1. To quantify the pooled risk of long-term cardiovascular outcomes following COVID-19 in young adults
2. To assess heterogeneity and sources of variability across studies
3. To evaluate the quality and bias of included studies
4. To provide evidence-based recommendations for clinical screening and prevention

## Methods

### Eligibility Criteria

#### Participants
- Young adults aged 18-39 years
- History of confirmed COVID-19 infection (based on PCR, antigen, or antibody testing)
- Comparison groups: Non-COVID-19 controls (preferably age- and sex-matched)

#### Interventions/Exposure
- SARS-CoV-2 infection (any variant)

#### Comparators
- Individuals without confirmed COVID-19 infection

#### Outcomes
**Primary Outcomes:**
- Myocarditis (diagnosed by clinical criteria, echocardiography, cardiac MRI, or biopsy)
- Cardiac arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, etc.)
- Thromboembolic events (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke)

**Secondary Outcomes:**
- Composite cardiovascular events
- Cardiovascular mortality
- Hospitalizations due to cardiovascular causes

#### Study Designs
- Cohort studies (prospective and retrospective)
- Population-based registries
- Electronic health records analysis
- Case-control studies (nested in cohorts)

### Information Sources and Search Strategy

#### Electronic Databases
- PubMed/MEDLINE
- Embase
- Cochrane Library
- Web of Science
- Scopus

#### Search Terms
("COVID-19" OR "SARS-CoV-2" OR "coronavirus") AND
("cardiovascular" OR "heart" OR "cardiac" OR "myocarditis" OR "arrhythmia" OR "thromboembolism" OR "thrombosis" OR "embolism") AND
("young adult*" OR "adolescent*" OR "age 18-39" OR "under 40") AND
("risk" OR "cohort" OR "long-term" OR "follow-up")

#### Date Range
- January 2020 to present (ongoing surveillance)

#### Language
- English language publications only

### Study Selection Process
1. Title/abstract screening by two independent reviewers
2. Full-text review by two independent reviewers
3. Disagreement resolution by third reviewer or consensus
4. Citation tracking of included studies

### Data Extraction
- Study characteristics (design, sample size, follow-up duration, population characteristics)
- Participant demographics (age, sex, comorbidities)
- COVID-19 characteristics (severity, variant, hospitalization)
- Outcome measures (incidence rates, risk ratios, odds ratios, hazard ratios)
- Adjustments (confounding variables controlled for)

### Risk of Bias Assessment
- Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies
- RoB 2 tool for randomized trials (if identified)
- Meta-bias assessment (publication bias via funnel plots and Egger's test)

### Data Synthesis
- Random-effects meta-analysis for pooled risk estimates
- Heterogeneity assessment (IÂ² statistic, Cochran's Q test)
- Subgroup analyses (stratified by follow-up time, COVID-19 severity, study quality)
- Meta-regression to explore sources of heterogeneity
- Sensitivity analyses excluding high-risk studies

### Publication Bias
- Funnel plot symmetry assessment
- Egger's regression test
- Trim-and-fill method for adjustment if publication bias detected

### Certainty of Evidence
- GRADE framework for assessing confidence in pooled estimates

### Statistical Software
- R (metafor, dmetar, netmeta packages)
- Stata or RevMan for additional analyses

## Expected Results
This systematic review will provide quantitative estimates of cardiovascular risk following COVID-19 in young adults, filling an important gap in the literature and informing clinical practice.
