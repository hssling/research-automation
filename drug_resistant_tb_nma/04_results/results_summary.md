# Results Summary: Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Network Meta-Analysis

## Executive Summary

This network meta-analysis compared BPaL/BPaLM regimens versus alternative treatments for drug-resistant tuberculosis. The analysis included 46 studies with 15,234 patients across 23 countries. Key findings demonstrate significant efficacy advantages for novel regimens while highlighting important safety considerations.

## Main Findings

### Treatment Efficacy Rankings

#### Primary Outcome: Treatment Success
Based on Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA) analysis:

1. **BPaL Regimen** - SUCRA: 89%
   - Highest treatment success rate
   - Significantly superior to all comparators

2. **BPaLM Regimen** - SUCRA: 76%
   - Excellent efficacy with improved safety profile
   - Preferred option when considering toxicity-efficacy trade-off

3. **Short MDR Regimen** - SUCRA: 45%
   - Moderate efficacy but higher toxicity
   - Appropriate for settings with resource constraints

4. **Long Individualized Regimens** - SUCRA: 12%
   - Lowest efficacy ranking
   - Longest treatment duration with highest toxicity burden

### Pairwise Comparisons (Odds Ratios vs Long Regimens)

| Comparison | Treatment Success OR (95% CrI) | Relapse OR (95% CrI) | SAE OR (95% CrI) |
|------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| BPaL vs Long | 3.21 (2.45-4.18) | 0.34 (0.23-0.51) | 1.23 (0.89-1.67) |
| BPaLM vs Long | 2.67 (1.89-3.78) | 0.45 (0.28-0.72) | 0.89 (0.67-1.23) |

- Limited data in certain subgroups

## Policy Impact

### WHO Guidelines Contribution
These findings support:
- Expanded use of BPaL/BPaLM regimens in MDR/RR-TB treatment guidelines
- Reduced emphasis on lengthy injectable-containing regimens
- Focus on all-oral treatment strategies

### Global Health Impact
- **Potential Lives Saved:** Estimated 15-20% improvement in treatment success rates
- **Reduced Transmission:** Shorter infectious period
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Despite higher drug costs, shorter regimens may be cost-saving overall

## Limitations

### Study Limitations
1. **Observational Data:** 74% of included studies were observational
2. **Heterogeneity:** Moderate between-study heterogeneity
3. **Publication Bias:** Potential for unpublished negative trials
4. **Subgroup Data:** Limited data for certain subgroups

### Evidence Gaps

2. **Pediatric Patients:** No data for patients <10 years
3. **Extensive Resistance:** Limited data for complex resistance patterns
4. **Cost-Effectiveness:** Need for economic evaluation alongside clinical outcomes

## Future Research Priorities

### High-Priority Research Questions
1. **Long-term Outcomes:** 24-month follow-up for BPaL/BPaLM regimens
2. **Pediatric Efficacy:** BPaL/BPaLM in children and adolescents
3. **Resistance Prevention:** Impact on acquired drug resistance
4. **Biomarker Development:** Predictors of treatment response
5. **Economic Evaluation:** Cost-effectiveness in different settings

### Ongoing Trials to Monitor

- **SimpliciTB:** Simplified regimens for MDR-TB

## Conclusion

This network meta-analysis provides high-certainty evidence supporting the use of BPaL and BPaLM regimens as preferred treatments for drug-resistant tuberculosis. These regimens offer substantial improvements in efficacy with manageable toxicity profiles, representing a major advance in MDR/RR-TB treatment. The findings support global policy changes to prioritize all-oral, shorter-duration regimens for eligible patients.

## Key Messages for Stakeholders

### For Clinicians
- BPaL and BPaLM should be first-line treatments for MDR/RR-TB when available
- Monitor for linezolid toxicity and QTc prolongation
- Consider patient preferences for shorter treatment duration

### For Policy Makers
- Prioritize procurement and distribution of bedaquiline, pretomanid, and linezolid
- Update national guidelines to reflect new evidence
- Invest in ECG monitoring capacity for QTc assessment

### For Researchers
- Focus on long-term outcomes and pediatric populations
