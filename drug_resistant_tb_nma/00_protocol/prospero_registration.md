## Review Objectives
To compare the efficacy and safety of BPaL/BPaLM regimens versus alternative treatment strategies for MDR/RR-TB using network meta-analysis, with particular focus on:
1. Treatment success rates
2. Relapse rates
3. Serious adverse events (neuropathy, myelosuppression, QTc prolongation)

## Review Methods

### Population
Adults and adolescents (≥10 years) with bacteriologically confirmed multidrug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB), with or without fluoroquinolone resistance. HIV co-infection acceptable if on appropriate antiretroviral therapy.

### Interventions
1. BPaL Regimen: Bedaquiline + pretomanid + linezolid (6 months)
2. BPaLM Regimen: Bedaquiline + pretomanid + linezolid + moxifloxacin (6 months)
3. Short MDR Regimen: WHO-recommended 9-12 month regimen
4. Individualized Long Regimens: 18-24 month customized treatments

### Comparator
All interventions will be compared against each other in the network meta-analysis framework.

### Outcomes
**Primary Outcomes:**
1. Treatment success (cure + treatment completion) at end of treatment
2. Relapse rate (recurrence within 12 months of treatment completion)
3. Serious adverse events (SAEs): peripheral neuropathy, myelosuppression, QTc prolongation

**Secondary Outcomes:**
1. Sputum culture conversion at 2 months
2. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events
3. Mortality (all-cause and TB-related)

### Study Design
- Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
- Quasi-randomized trials
- Prospective observational studies with concurrent controls
- Retrospective studies with appropriate adjustment for confounding

## Search Methods

### Electronic Search Strategies
**Databases to be Searched:**
- PubMed/MEDLINE
- Embase
- Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
- Web of Science
- WHO Global Index Medicus

**Trial Registries:**
- ClinicalTrials.gov
- TB Trials Tracker
- WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform

### Search Terms
**Population Terms:** "MDR-TB" OR "RR-TB" OR "multidrug resistant tuberculosis" OR "rifampicin resistant tuberculosis" OR "drug-resistant tuberculosis"

**Intervention Terms:** "bedaquiline" OR "pretomanid" OR "linezolid" OR "BPaL" OR "BPaLM" OR "short MDR regimen" OR "individualized regimen"

**Design Terms:** "randomized controlled trial" OR "clinical trial" OR "observational study" OR "cohort study" OR "case control study"

### Language and Date Restrictions
- **Language:** English (primary), with consideration for translation of high-impact non-English studies
- **Date:** January 2010 to present (BPaL development era)
- **No geographic restrictions**

## Data Collection and Analysis

### Selection of Studies
- Two independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts
- Full-text review of potentially eligible studies
- Discrepancies resolved by third reviewer
- PRISMA flow diagram will document selection process

### Data Extraction
Standardized forms will collect:
- Study characteristics (design, setting, sample size, year)
- Patient demographics (age, sex, HIV status, resistance patterns)
- Intervention details (drugs, doses, duration, concomitant medications)
- Outcome measures (definitions, timing, results)
- Risk of bias assessment

### Assessment of Risk of Bias in Included Studies
- **RCTs:** Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool
- **Observational Studies:** ROBINS-I tool
- **Publication Bias:** Funnel plots and Egger's test

### Strategy for Data Synthesis
- **Network Meta-Analysis:** Bayesian random-effects model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation
- **Component Network Meta-Analysis:** To evaluate individual drug contributions and dose effects
- **Heterogeneity Assessment:** I² statistic, node-splitting for inconsistency
- **Ranking Analysis:** Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA)
- **Certainty of Evidence:** GRADE approach adapted for network meta-analysis

### Analysis of Subgroups or Subsets
1. Fluoroquinolone resistance status
2. HIV co-infection
3. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB)
4. Geographic regions (high vs low TB burden)

## Dissemination Plans
- Publication in high-impact peer-reviewed journal (The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Clinical Infectious Diseases, or similar)
- Presentation at international conferences (Union World Conference on Lung Health, CROI)
- Contribution to WHO technical consultations
- Policy brief for national TB programs

## Keywords
BPaL, BPaLM, MDR-TB, RR-TB, network meta-analysis, drug-resistant tuberculosis, bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid

## Date and Version
- **Date:** October 12, 2025
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Amendments:** Any protocol amendments will be documented and reported

## Additional Notes
This systematic review and network meta-analysis will inform the 2026 WHO tuberculosis treatment guidelines update and contribute to global policy decisions regarding optimal treatment strategies for drug-resistant tuberculosis.
