## Abstract
**Background:** Multidrug-resistant and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) presents a significant global health challenge. The BPaL (bedaquiline-pretomanid-linezolid) and BPaLM (bedaquiline-pretomanid-linezolid-moxifloxacin) regimens represent promising shorter treatment options compared to traditional lengthy regimens. However, head-to-head comparisons are limited.

**Objectives:** To compare the efficacy and safety of BPaL/BPaLM regimens versus alternative treatment strategies for MDR/RR-TB using network meta-analysis.

**Methods:** We will conduct a systematic review and Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis with component modeling to evaluate treatment outcomes including cure rates, relapse rates, and serious adverse events (neuropathy, myelosuppression, QTc prolongation).

**Data Sources:** WHO TB reviews, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, TB Trials Tracker
**Eligibility Criteria:** Randomized controlled trials and observational studies including adults and adolescents with MDR/RR-TB (with or without fluoroquinolone resistance) comparing BPaL, BPaLM, short MDR regimens, or individualized long regimens.

## Background and Rationale

### Burden of Disease
- MDR/RR-TB affects approximately 500,000 people annually
- Treatment success rates remain suboptimal (approximately 60%)
- Traditional regimens are lengthy (18-24 months) and poorly tolerated

### Current Treatment Landscape
- **BPaL Regimen:** 6-month oral regimen (bedaquiline + pretomanid + linezolid)
- **BPaLM Regimen:** Modified BPaL with moxifloxacin instead of part of linezolid course
- **Short MDR Regimen:** 9-12 month regimen based on WHO guidelines
- **Individualized Long Regimens:** 18-24 month customized treatments

### Rationale for NMA
- Limited head-to-head trials between newer and traditional regimens
- Need for indirect comparisons to inform treatment guidelines
- Component network meta-analysis allows evaluation of individual drug contributions

## Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. To compare treatment success (cure + treatment completion) rates between BPaL/BPaLM and alternative regimens
2. To evaluate relapse rates across different treatment strategies
3. To assess the safety profile focusing on serious adverse events

### Secondary Objectives
1. To rank treatments using Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA) analysis
2. To evaluate the impact of fluoroquinolone resistance on treatment outcomes
3. To assess the contribution of individual drugs using component network meta-analysis

## Methods

### Study Design
- Systematic review and network meta-analysis
- Bayesian random-effects model
- Component network meta-analysis for drug dose evaluation

### Eligibility Criteria

#### Population (P)
- Adults and adolescents (≥10 years) with bacteriologically confirmed MDR/RR-TB
- With or without fluoroquinolone resistance
- HIV co-infection acceptable if on appropriate antiretroviral therapy

#### Interventions (I) and Comparators (C)
1. **BPaL Regimen:** Bedaquiline + pretomanid + linezolid (6 months)
2. **BPaLM Regimen:** Bedaquiline + pretomanid + linezolid + moxifloxacin (6 months)
3. **Short MDR Regimen:** WHO-recommended 9-12 month regimen
4. **Individualized Long Regimens:** 18-24 month customized treatments

#### Outcomes (O)
**Primary Outcomes:**
1. Treatment success (cure + treatment completion) at end of treatment
2. Relapse rate (recurrence within 12 months of treatment completion)
3. Serious adverse events (SAEs):
   - Peripheral neuropathy
   - Myelosuppression (anemia, thrombocytopenia)
   - QTc prolongation >500ms or requiring treatment discontinuation

**Secondary Outcomes:**
1. Sputum culture conversion at 2 months
2. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events
3. Mortality (all-cause and TB-related)
4. Time to sputum culture conversion

#### Study Designs
- Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
- Quasi-randomized trials
- Prospective observational studies with concurrent controls
- Retrospective studies with appropriate adjustment for confounding

### Search Strategy
**Date Range:** January 2010 to present (BPaL development era)
**Language:** English (primary), but will consider translation for high-impact non-English studies
**Keywords:** "bedaquiline", "pretomanid", "linezolid", "BPaL", "BPaLM", "MDR-TB", "RR-TB", "multidrug resistant tuberculosis", "rifampicin resistant tuberculosis"

### Data Synthesis

#### Statistical Methods
1. **Network Meta-Analysis:**

   - Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation
   - Non-informative priors for treatment effects

2. **Component Network Meta-Analysis:**
   - Evaluate contribution of individual drugs
   - Assess linezolid dose effects
   - Model drug interactions
