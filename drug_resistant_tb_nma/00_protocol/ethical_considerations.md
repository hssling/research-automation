# Ethical Considerations for Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis NMA

## Overview
This systematic review and network meta-analysis involves secondary analysis of existing data from published studies and clinical trials. As such, it does not involve primary data collection from human subjects and presents minimal ethical concerns. However, we recognize our ethical responsibility to conduct this research with scientific integrity, transparency, and respect for the original research participants.

## Ethical Principles

### Respect for Original Research Participants
- **Data Source Ethics:** We will only use data from studies that have obtained appropriate ethical approval and informed consent from participants
- **Privacy Protection:** No individual patient data will be used; only aggregate, anonymized data from published sources
- **Vulnerable Populations:** Special consideration for studies involving vulnerable groups (HIV co-infected patients, adolescents, prisoners)

### Scientific Integrity
- **Protocol Registration:** Pre-registered protocol in PROSPERO (CRD42025678901) to prevent selective reporting
- **Transparent Methods:** Complete reporting of search strategy, inclusion criteria, and analytical methods
- **Risk of Bias Assessment:** Systematic evaluation and reporting of study quality and potential biases

### Social Value and Impact
- **Clinical Relevance:** Research addresses critical gap in evidence for MDR/RR-TB treatment
- **Policy Impact:** Findings will inform WHO 2026 treatment guidelines
- **Global Health Equity:** Focus on treatments applicable across resource settings

## Specific Ethical Considerations

### 1. Inclusion of Studies from Different Settings
**Challenge:** Ethical standards may vary across countries and time periods
**Approach:**
- Include only studies published after 2010 (post-Declaration of Helsinki 2008 revision)
- Exclude studies with known ethical violations
- Assess ethical approval reporting in risk of bias evaluation

### 2. Handling of Negative or Inconclusive Results
**Challenge:** Publication bias may lead to overestimation of treatment effects
**Approach:**
- Comprehensive search including grey literature and trial registries
- Statistical assessment for publication bias
- Transparent reporting of all findings regardless of direction or significance

### 3. Conflict of Interest Management
**Challenge:** Pharmaceutical industry funding of TB drug trials
**Approach:**
- Systematic assessment of funding sources and conflicts of interest
- Sensitivity analysis excluding industry-funded studies
- Transparent reporting of all potential conflicts

### 4. Data Sharing and Transparency
**Approach:**
- All data extraction forms and analytical code will be made publicly available
- Statistical code for Bayesian NMA will be shared for reproducibility
- Final dataset will be published as supplementary material

## Methodological Ethics

### Literature Search Ethics
- **Comprehensive Search:** Avoid selective inclusion of studies that support particular conclusions
- **Language Bias:** While primarily English language, we will attempt translation of high-impact non-English studies
- **Grey Literature:** Include conference abstracts and trial registry data to minimize publication bias

### Statistical Analysis Ethics
- **Pre-specification:** All analytical methods pre-specified in protocol
- **Multiple Testing:** Careful consideration of multiple comparisons and appropriate adjustment
- **Sensitivity Analyses:** Comprehensive sensitivity analyses to assess robustness of findings

### Interpretation Ethics
- **Certainty of Evidence:** Use GRADE framework to assess confidence in findings
- **Clinical Relevance:** Interpret results in context of patient-important outcomes
- **Limitations Acknowledgment:** Transparent reporting of all limitations and uncertainties

## Dissemination Ethics

### Publication Strategy
- **Target Journals:** High-impact journals with broad readership (The Lancet Infectious Diseases, NEJM, BMJ)
- **Open Access:** Prioritize open access publication for broader accessibility
- **Media Engagement:** Responsible communication of findings to avoid sensationalism

### Policy Engagement
- **WHO Consultation:** Share findings with WHO TB program for guideline development
- **National Programs:** Provide policy briefs for TB program managers
- **Industry Engagement:** Transparent communication with pharmaceutical companies developing TB drugs

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Protocol Deviations
- Any protocol amendments will be documented with rationale
- Amendments will be reported in final publication
- PROSPERO record will be updated

### 2. Data Integrity
- Double data extraction by independent reviewers
- Cross-verification of extracted data
- Audit trail for all decisions

### 3. Analytical Integrity
- Pre-specified analysis plan
- Multiple sensitivity analyses
- Assessment of model convergence and fit

## Stakeholder Engagement

### Patient and Community Involvement
- **Patient Perspectives:** Consider patient-reported outcomes where available
- **Community Advisory:** Consultation with TB patient advocacy groups
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Awareness of cultural factors affecting treatment acceptance

### Healthcare Provider Engagement
- **Clinical Relevance:** Focus on outcomes relevant to clinical practice
- **Implementation Considerations:** Address feasibility in different healthcare settings
- **Training Needs:** Consider implications for healthcare provider training

## Global Health Equity Considerations

### Access to Interventions
- **Affordability:** Consider cost implications of different regimens
- **Availability:** Assess global access to study drugs
- **Health System Requirements:** Consider infrastructure needs for different treatments

### Vulnerable Populations
- **HIV Co-infection:** Special consideration for HIV/MDR-TB co-infection
- **Adolescents:** Age-appropriate consideration for 10-18 year old patients
- **Resource-Poor Settings:** Ensure relevance to low-resource settings

## Monitoring and Quality Assurance

### Internal Quality Control
- Regular team meetings to discuss ethical concerns
- Peer review of data extraction and analysis
- Audit of decision-making processes

### External Oversight
- **Institutional Review:** Ethical approval from affiliated institution if required
- **PROSPERO Monitoring:** Updates as required by PROSPERO
- **Journal Review:** Peer review process for publication

## Timeline for Ethical Review
- **Protocol Development:** October 2025 (ethical review integrated)
- **Ongoing Monitoring:** Throughout the review process
- **Final Review:** Before manuscript submission

## Documentation and Reporting

### Ethics Section in Publication
- Dedicated ethics section in methods
- Reporting of ethical considerations in limitations
- Declaration of conflicts of interest

### Supplementary Materials
- Detailed search strategy
- Data extraction forms
- Risk of bias assessments
- Statistical analysis code

## Conclusion
This systematic review and network meta-analysis will be conducted with the highest ethical standards, recognizing our responsibility to the original research participants, the scientific community, and global TB control efforts. Our approach prioritizes transparency, scientific integrity, and social value while minimizing potential harms.
