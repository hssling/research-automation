## Hand Searching and Reference Mining

### Reference List Screening
- Screen reference lists of all included studies
- Screen relevant review articles and meta-analyses
- Use citation tracking in Web of Science and Google Scholar

### Expert Consultation
- Contact key opinion leaders in MDR-TB treatment
- Consult with WHO TB programme staff
- Reach out to principal investigators of major trials

## Search Documentation and Reporting

### Search Record Keeping
- **Search Log:** Document all searches with dates, platforms, and results
- **Search Strings:** Save exact search strategies for reproducibility
- **Result Export:** Export search results with abstracts where possible

### PRISMA-S Compliance
- Follow PRISMA-S guidelines for search strategy reporting
- Include supplementary material with full search strategies
- Document search strategy development process

## Search Update Strategy

### Regular Updates
- **Monthly Monitoring:** Google Scholar alerts for key terms
- **Quarterly Updates:** Database searches for new publications
- **Pre-submission Update:** Final search update before manuscript submission

### Update Documentation
- Document all search updates with dates and additional yields
- Update PRISMA flow diagram accordingly
- Assess impact of new studies on review findings

## Quality Assurance for Search Strategy

### Peer Review of Search Strategy
- **Librarian Review:** Consultation with medical librarian
- **Expert Review:** Review by TB information specialist
- **Pilot Testing:** Test search strategy on known relevant articles

### Search Sensitivity and Precision
- **Sensitivity Check:** Ensure all known relevant studies are captured
- **Precision Optimization:** Balance comprehensive capture with manageable results
- **Validation:** Compare search yield with existing reviews

## Language and Geographic Considerations

### Language Strategy
- **Primary:** English language publications
- **Secondary:** High-impact publications in other languages (with translation)
- **Translation Resources:** Use Google Translate or professional services for non-English abstracts

### Geographic Coverage
- **No Restrictions:** Include studies from all geographic regions
- **LMIC Focus:** Prioritize studies from high TB burden countries
- **Generalizability:** Assess applicability across different settings

## Search Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Evolving Terminology
**Problem:** BPaL and BPaLM are relatively new terms
**Solution:** Use component drug names; update searches as terminology evolves

### Challenge 2: Publication Bias
**Problem:** Negative trials may be unpublished
**Solution:** Comprehensive trial registry search; contact investigators

### Challenge 3: Conference Abstracts
**Problem:** Limited indexing of conference abstracts
**Solution:** Hand search conference websites; contact authors for updates

## Expected Search Yield

### Estimated Study Volume
- **Primary Database Search:** 500-800 abstracts
- **Trial Registries:** 50-100 registered trials
- **Grey Literature:** 100-200 additional sources
- **Final Included Studies:** 20-40 studies (based on similar reviews)

### Yield Management
- **Abstract Screening:** Two independent reviewers
- **Full-text Review:** All potentially eligible abstracts
- **Inter-reviewer Agreement:** Kappa statistic for agreement assessment

## Search Strategy Validation

### Known Studies Test
Test search strategy against known relevant studies:
1. Nix-TB trial (BPaL regimen)
2. ZeNix trial (BPaLM regimen)
3. STREAM trial (short MDR regimen)
4. Various observational studies

### Performance Metrics
- **Sensitivity:** Percentage of known relevant studies captured
- **Precision:** Percentage of retrieved studies that are relevant
- **Number Needed to Read:** Average number of abstracts to find one relevant study
