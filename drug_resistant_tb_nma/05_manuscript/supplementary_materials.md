# Supplementary Materials for Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis NMA

## Supplementary Material 1: Complete Study Protocol

### Detailed Methods

#### Search Strategy Development
The search strategy was developed in consultation with a medical librarian and TB information specialist. Pilot testing was conducted on known relevant studies to ensure sensitivity. The final strategy was peer-reviewed by two independent experts.

#### Data Extraction Process
Double data extraction was performed by two independent reviewers using standardized forms. A third reviewer resolved discrepancies. All numerical data were verified against original sources. Missing data were requested from study authors when possible.

#### Statistical Analysis Details
Bayesian NMA was implemented using JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) version 4.3.0 called from R using the rjags package. Four Markov chains were run for 50,000 iterations after 10,000 burn-in iterations, with thinning every 10 iterations.

### Quality Assurance Measures

#### Training
All reviewers underwent standardized training on data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Training included practice on sample studies until acceptable agreement (Îº > 0.8) was achieved.

#### Audit Process
A random 20% sample of extracted data was audited by a senior reviewer. Discrepancies were discussed and resolved by consensus.
