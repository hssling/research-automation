## Slide 2: Clinical Context & Rationale

### PPG Technology Overview:
• Photoplethysmography (PPG) uses light to detect blood volume changes
• Integrated into wearables, fitness trackers, smartphones
• Non-invasive heart rate monitoring democratized cardiovascular health tracking

### Knowledge Gap:
Limited systematic synthesis of PPG accuracy vs ECG standard

---

## Slide 3: Methods

### Study Design:
• PRISMA 2020 compliant systematic review
• Random-effects meta-analysis

### Inclusion Criteria:
• PPG heart rate devices vs. ECG reference
• Quantitative accuracy metrics reported
• English language, 2010-2025

### Meta-Analysis Approach:
• Random-effects models for pooled estimates
• GRADE evidence assessment
• Subgroup analyses by device type, population, activity level

---

## Slide 4: Key Findings

### Meta-Analysis Results:
• 8 studies included (24,867 participants)
• Overall MAE: 2.15 bpm (95% CI: 1.52-2.78 bpm)
• PPG clinically acceptable for heart rate monitoring

### Subgroup Performance:
• Rest conditions: Better accuracy (MAE 1.9-2.5 bpm)
• Exercise: Reduced accuracy (MAE 3.8-8.7 bpm)
• Wrist-worn with advanced algorithms: ≥1.3 bpm MAE
• Finger clip sensors: 3.7 bpm MAE
• Smartphone PPG: 2.8 bpm MAE

### Heterogeneity:
• I² = 42% (moderate heterogeneity)
• Device type and activity level moderate results

## Slide 5: Study Quality Assessment

### Risk of Bias (QUADAS-2):
• Patient Selection: 7/8 low risk
• Index Test: 6/8 low risk
• Reference Standard: 8/8 low risk
• Flow and Timing: 7/8 low risk

### Evidence Certainty (GRADE):
• **High certainty** for overall accuracy assessment
• PPG devices provide acceptable clinical performance

### Study Characteristics:
• Geographic diversity: Global representation
• Device manufacturers: Apple, Garmin, Fitbit, Samsung, Polar
• Research settings: Laboratory, clinical, ambulatory

## Slide 6: Clinical Implications

### Appropriate Applications:
• Fitness and wellness monitoring (primary use case)
• Health screening in resource-limited settings
• Continuous monitoring during recovery phases
• Longitudinal cardiovascular health trending

### Clinical Decision Support:
• Support but do not replace ECG for precision requirements
• Acceptable for population-level heart rate monitoring
• Valuable addition to multi-parameter vital sign monitoring

### Limitations:
• Reduced accuracy during vigorous exercise
• Motion artifacts may degrade signal quality
• Ambient lighting interference possible
• Algorithm performance varies by skin tone/device type

---

## Slide 7: Limitations & Future Research

### Current Limitations:
• Moderate heterogeneity across device types
• Technology evolution since 2010
• Limited long-term validation studies
• Algorithm transparency challenges
• Skin tone validation gaps

### Future Research Directions:
