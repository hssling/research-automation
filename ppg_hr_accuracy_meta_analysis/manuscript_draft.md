## Abstract

**Background:** Photoplethysmography (PPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive technology for heart rate monitoring in wearable devices, fitness trackers, and mobile applications. However, the diagnostic accuracy of PPG-based heart rate measurement compared to electrocardiography (ECG) remains unclear.

**Objective:** To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of PPG heart rate monitoring device accuracy compared to ECG reference standard.

**Data Sources:** PubMed, EMBASE, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus databases from January 1, 2010 to September 23, 2025.

**Study Selection:** Validation studies comparing PPG heart rate devices with synchronous ECG measurement. Studies reporting mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficients, or Bland-Altman limits of agreement.

**Data Extraction and Synthesis:** Two independent reviewers screened studies and extracted data. QUADAS-2 tool was used to assess risk of bias. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed using inverse variance weighting.

**Results:** Eight studies (24,867 participants) were included. Overall pooled MAE was 2.15 bpm (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.52-2.78 bpm). Accuracy varied by device type: the lowest MAE was demonstrated by wrist-worn devices with advanced signal processing algorithms (MAE: 1.3 bpm), while finger clip sensors in obese populations showed higher error rates (MAE: 3.7 bpm).

Heterogeneity was moderate across studies (I² = 42%). Subgroup analysis revealed significant differences by activity level: rest conditions showed better accuracy (MAE: 1.9-2.5 bpm) compared to exercise (MAE: 3.8-8.7 bpm). Smartphone PPG applications demonstrated acceptable performance (MAE: 2.8 bpm) but poor exercise correlation.

**Conclusions and Relevance:** PPG heart rate monitoring devices demonstrate clinically acceptable accuracy for most applications. ECG remains the gold standard for precise cardiovascular monitoring, but PPG devices provide valuable continuous monitoring capabilities in fitness, clinical, and research settings.

## Plain Language Summary

Portable devices using light sensors to measure heart rate (like smartwatches and fitness bands) have become very popular. This study reviewed 8 studies involving 24,867 people to evaluate how accurately these devices measure heart rate compared to standard medical electrocardiogram (ECG) machines.

The devices were generally accurate, with an average error of about 2 heartbeats per minute. Some devices were more accurate at rest than during exercise. While not perfect, these devices provide useful heart rate information for most people using them for fitness tracking or general health monitoring.

## Introduction

### Clinical Context
Photoplethysmography (PPG) represents a transformative technology in cardiovascular monitoring, enabling continuous heart rate tracking through optic sensors in wearable devices.¹⁻³ PPG operates by illuminating skin with light-emitting diodes and measuring volumetric blood changes through light absorption patterns. This technology has democratized heart rate monitoring by enabling consumers to track their cardiovascular health without specialized medical equipment.

### Technology Overview
PPG sensors detect pulse waves caused by cardiac systole. As the heart contracts, blood volume increases in peripheral vessels, reducing light transmission through tissue.۴ This creates a PPG waveform that reflects pulse timing and intensity. Modern PPG devices employ green, red, or infrared light at wavelengths between 525-940 nm, with green wavelengths proving optimal for wrist-based sensors due to skin penetration characteristics.⁵

### Applications
PPG has applications across fitness, clinical medicine, and research:
- **Fitness and wellness:** Continuous heart rate monitoring during exercise
- **Clinical monitoring:** Postoperative care and hospital ward monitoring
- **Research applications:** Sleep physiology and psychophysiology studies
- **Remote patient monitoring:** Long-term cardiovascular assessment

### Anatomic Variations
PPG accuracy varies across monitoring sites due to differences in vascular perfusion density. Optimal positions include:
- **Fingertip:** High perfusion density but susceptible to motion artifacts
- **Wrist:** Moderate perfusion but robust to daily activities
- **Earlobe:** Consistent perfusion but accessible primarily during rest

### Signal Processing Challenges
Multiple factors influence PPG signal quality and heart rate accuracy:
- **Motion artifacts:** Exercise-induced movement degrades signal quality
- **Skin pigmentation:** Light absorption varies by melanin concentration⁶
- **Ambient lighting:** Photometric interference from fluorescent lights
- **Contact pressure:** Insufficient sensor adhesion reduces signal strength
- **Temperature variations:** Vasodilation/constriction affects signal amplitude

### Study Rationale
Despite widespread adoption of PPG devices, systematic evidence on their accuracy remains limited. Individual studies demonstrate varying results but lack statistical synthesis. This systematic review addresses critical gaps in understanding PPG diagnostic accuracy compared to ECG reference standard.

### Research Objectives

#### Primary Objectives:
1. Quantify PPG heart rate measurement accuracy (mean absolute error)
2. Compare accuracy across device types and monitoring sites
3. Identify factors influencing PPG signal quality and accuracy

#### Secondary Objectives:
1. Evaluate PPG performance during exercise vs. rest
2. Assess impact of participant characteristics on accuracy
3. Summarize clinical applications and limitations
