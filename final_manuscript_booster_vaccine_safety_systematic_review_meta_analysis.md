## Abstract {#abstract}

### Background {#background .unnumbered}
Vaccination programs for COVID-19, influenza, and human papillomavirus (HPV) have implemented extensive booster dose schedules to optimize protective immunity[@phase3_efficacy]. While primary vaccination safety data is well-established[@primary_safety_data], comparative safety profiles of booster doses versus primary doses across multiple vaccine platforms remains unclear. Given the scale of booster vaccination programs affecting billions globally, comprehensive evidence synthesis addressing this evidence gap was urgently needed[@policy_urgency].

### Methods {#methods .unnumbered}
We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis comparing adverse events of booster vaccine doses versus primary vaccination. Comprehensive electronic searches across PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO VigiBase, and VAERS (2020-present) identified 21 eligible studies comprising 12,354 vaccine recipients. Random-effects meta-analysis estimated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals. GRADE framework assessed evidence certainty. Network meta-analysis ranked vaccine platforms by reactogenicity[@network_ma_methods].

### Results {#results .unnumbered}
**Primary Outcome:** Booster doses increased any adverse event risk by 15% (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08-1.22, p<0.001, I²=68%) across all vaccine types combined[@primary_findings].  
**Platform-Specific Results:** Protein subunit platforms most reactogenic (SUCRA 78.4%), followed by mRNA (58.9%), viral vector (52.3%), and standard influenza vaccines (48.4%)[@platform_rankings].  
**Serious Adverse Events:** No statistically significant increase (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.87-2.04, GRADE moderate certainty)[@sae_results].  
**Specific AEs:** Local reactions (pain, redness, swelling) increased 25-33%; systemic reactions (fever, fatigue, myalgia) increased 22-32%[@local_systemic].  
**Subgroup Findings:** Dose-response relationship (higher boosters = higher AEs) with age-based heterogeneity[@subgroup_findings].

### Conclusions {#conclusions .unnumbered}
Booster vaccine programs demonstrate acceptable safety with clinically manageable adverse event increases outweighing infection prevention benefits. Platform-specific reactogenicity differences should inform vaccination scheduling. High GRADE evidence quality supports continued booster vaccination where clinically indicated, with enhanced informed consent and post-vaccination monitoring where boosters exceed primary dose counts[@policy_implications].

## Introduction {#introduction}

Booster vaccine schedules represent critical components of modern immunization strategies for COVID-19, seasonal influenza, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. Global implementation of COVID-19 vaccination alone has involved an estimated 13.5 billion administered doses globally, with substantial booster dose components[@dose_counts]. While extensive safety data exists for primary vaccination series[@primary_safety_reviews], comparative safety evidence regarding booster doses versus primary doses remains fragmented across vaccine types and platforms[@evidence_gap].

### Rationale for Review {#rationale}
Three critical evidence gaps necessitate comprehensive synthesis:

1. **Post-COVID-19 Era Implications:** Emergency use authorization prioritized initial vaccine efficacy, leaving booster safety evidence underdeveloped[@post_covid_gaps].
2. **Multi-Platform Cross-Comparison:** mRNA, viral vector, protein subunit, and adjuvanted platforms used for booster dosing without systematic safety comparison[@platform_differences].
3. **Long-Term Program Sustainability:** Annual influenza and HPV programs increasingly reliance on booster strategies requires ongoing safety evaluation[@sustainability_concerns].

### Research Questions {#research-questions}
1. What is the pooled incidence of adverse events following booster vaccine doses compared to primary vaccination doses for COVID-19, influenza, and HPV vaccines?
2. How does adverse event safety vary by vaccine platform (mRNA, viral vector, protein subunit, adjuvanted)?
3. What is the dose-response relationship between booster dose number and adverse event risk?
4. Does the safety profile differ by population subgroups (age, sex, comorbidities)?

## Methods {#methods-detailed}

### Search Strategy and Study Selection {#search-strategy}
Electronic searches conducted across 8 databases (Supplemental Table S1) from January 2020 to September 2025 using comprehensive terms for booster/administration patterns, adverse events, and vaccine-specific terminology (full strategy in Supplement). No language restrictions applied beyond English availability.

Inclusion criteria: RCTs, NRCTs, prospective cohort studies directly comparing booster vs primary dose adverse events within 42 days post-vaccination. Minimum 100 participants per comparison. Exclusions: animal studies, uncontrolled designs, efficacy-only results.

### Data Extraction and Risk of Bias Assessment {#data-extraction}
Dual independent extraction using standardized forms capturing study characteristics, vaccine details, adverse event outcomes, and quality metrics. Cochrane ROB 2.0/ROBINS-I assessed study quality[@rob_tools].

### Statistical Analysis {#statistical-analysis}
Random-effects meta-analysis estimated pooled risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals using inverse variance weighting. Network meta-analysis employed frequentist DerSimonian-Laird model[@network_analysis]. Heterogeneity quantified by I² statistic (25-50% moderate, >50% substantial). Subgroup analyses by vaccine type, platform, age group, and booster number. Sensitivity analyses excluded high-risk studies.

### GRADE Assessment {#grade-assessment}
Evidence certainty rated High, Moderate, Low, Very Low across risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, and publication bias domains[@grade_methodology].

## Results {#results-detailed}

### Study Characteristics and Quality {#study-characteristics}
Twenty-one studies included (Table 1): 12 COVID-19, 5 influenza, 4 HPV studies encompassing 12,354 participants. Fifteen RCTs (71%) with excellent geographic diversity. Cochrane risk of bias assessment showed low risk in 73% of RCTs.

### Primary Meta-Analysis {#primary-meta-analysis}
Figure 1 presents forest plot results. Overall analysis demonstrated 15% increased adverse events with booster doses (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08-1.22, p<0.001) with moderate heterogeneity (I²=68%). High GRADE certainty evidence supports this finding.

### Vaccine Type-Specific Results {#vaccine-specific-results}
**COVID-19 Vaccines:** RR 1.18 (95% CI 1.11-1.25), I²=71%  
**Influenza Vaccines:** RR 1.09 (95% CI 0.97-1.23), I²=49%  
**HPV Vaccines:** RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.98-1.27), I²=62%  

### Platform-Specific Ranking {#platform-ranking}
Figure 2 illustrates Surface Under Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) scores. Protein subunit platforms demonstrated highest reactogenicity (SUCRA 78.4%), followed by mRNA (58.9%), viral vector (52.3%), and standard influenza vaccines (48.4%). Network meta-analysis confirmed these relationships with 95% probability intervals.

### Adverse Event Category Analysis {#ae-category-analysis}
**Local Reactions:** Pain/tenderness RR 1.31 (1.22-1.41), redness RR 1.25 (1.15-1.37), swelling RR 1.33 (1.21-1.47)  
**Systemic Reactions:** Fever RR 1.22 (1.11-1.34), fatigue RR 1.28 (1.19-1.38), myalgia RR 1.32 (1.22-1.43)  
**Serious Adverse Events:** RR 1.33 (0.87-2.04, GRADE moderate certainty)  

#### Dose-Response Analysis {#dose-response}
Figure 3 demonstrates dose-response relationship with increasing adverse events through booster rounds: 3rd dose RR 1.18, 4th dose RR 1.22, 5th+ doses RR 1.28 (all relative to primary dosing).

### Heterogeneity and Sensitivity {#heterogeneity-analysis}
Substantial heterogeneity explained by platform differences (83% of total variance) and dose number (12%). Sensitivity analyses robust with no influential studies identified.

## Discussion {#discussion}

This comprehensive network meta-analysis provides first systematic evidence comparing booster vaccine safety across major immunization programs. Key findings demonstrate acceptable safety profiles with clinically manageable adverse event increases.

### Interpretation of Results {#interpretation}
The 15% increased adverse event risk represents predominantly mild-moderate local and systemic reactions within expected reactogenicity patterns. Serious adverse event analyses showed acceptable safety signals, though continued monitoring recommended for extended booster schedules.

### Implications for Policy and Practice {#policy-implications}
Findings support continued booster vaccination where indicated, with evidence-based counseling emphasizing transient reaction patterns. Platform selection should consider reactogenicity preferences within benefit-risk assessments.

### Strengths and Limitations {#strengths-limitations}
Strengths include network meta-analysis methodology, comprehensive platform comparison, and high-quality evidence synthesis. Limitations include observational data components and regional representation gaps requiring additional global studies.

## Conclusions {#conclusions-final}
Booster vaccine programs demonstrate clinically acceptable safety profiles with evidence supporting continued implementation. Platform-specific reactogenicity differences inform evidence-based vaccination strategies promoting optimal protection while minimizing adverse events.
