# PROSPERO Registration: Comparative Safety of Booster Vaccines

**Title:** Comparative Safety of Booster Vaccines (COVID-19, Influenza, HPV): A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Adverse Events Following Booster Doses Compared to Primary Vaccination

**CRD420246789261** - Temporary Registration Number (To be registered with PROSPERO)

---

## Review Question(s)

### Primary Research Question
What is the pooled incidence of adverse events following booster vaccine doses compared to primary vaccination doses for COVID-19, influenza, and HPV vaccines?

### Secondary Research Questions
1. What is the comparative risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) between booster and primary doses?
2. How does safety profile vary by vaccine type (mRNA, viral vector, adjuvanted, viral)?
3. What is the dose-response relationship between number of booster doses and adverse events?
4. Does safety profile differ by population subgroups (age, sex, comorbidities)?

### Condition or Domain Being Studied
- Vaccinations against COVID-19, influenza, or HPV
- Focus on booster doses (≥3rd dose for COVID-19, ≥2nd dose for influenza/HPV)
- Comparative safety with primary vaccination series

### Participants/Population
- Recipients of COVID-19, influenza, or HPV vaccines
- Any age group including vulnerable populations
- Healthcare workers, general adult population, elderly, pediatrics (where applicable)

### Intervention(s), Exposure(s)
- Booster vaccine doses as per WHO/CDC recommendations
- Any formulation within same vaccine platform (mRNA, viral vector, adjuvanted)
- Minimum 100 participants per comparison group required

### Comparator(s)/Control
- Primary vaccination series (doses 1-2) from same vaccine program
- Same vaccine type for head-to-head comparison
- No vaccination control groups (focus on intra-vaccine comparisons)

### Outcome(s)
- **Primary Outcome:** Any adverse events within 7-42 days post-vaccination
- **Secondary Outcomes:**
  - Serious adverse events (SAEs) - hospitalization, life-threatening events, disability
  - Local reactions - injection site pain, swelling, redness, induration
  - Systemic reactions - fever, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia
  - Allergic reactions - urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis
  - Specific outcomes by vaccine:
    - COVID-19: myocarditis, pericarditis, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)
    - Influenza: Guillain-Barré syndrome, hospitalization rates
    - HPV: local exacerbation of cutaneous conditions

**Principal outcome(s):** Any adverse events following booster vs primary doses

### Timing
- Adverse events measured within 7-42 days post-vaccination
- Comparative assessment between booster and primary dose timepoints

## Information Sources and Search Strategy

### Search Strategy
Comprehensive electronic database search across medical literature and regulatory sources.

**Core Search Terms:**
((COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR influenza OR HPV OR human papillomavirus) AND (booster OR additional dose OR repeat vaccination OR supplementary dose) AND (adverse event* OR safety OR reactogenicity OR side effect* OR tolerability) AND (versus OR compared OR vs OR primary))

**Sample PubMed Query:**
```
((COVID-19[Title/Abstract] OR SARS-CoV-2[Title/Abstract] OR influenza[Title/Abstract] OR HPV[Title/Abstract] OR human papillomavirus[Title/Abstract])) AND ((booster[Title/Abstract] OR additional dose[Title/Abstract] OR repeat vaccination[Title/Abstract] OR supplementary dose[Title/Abstract])) AND ((adverse event*[Title/Abstract] OR safety[Title/Abstract] OR reactogenicity[Title/Abstract] OR side effect*[Title/Abstract] OR tolerability[Title/Abstract]) AND (versus[Title/Abstract] OR compared[Title/Abstract] OR vs[Title/Abstract] OR primary[Title/Abstract]))
```

**Databases:**
1. PubMed/MEDLINE (Ovid interface)
2. EMBASE (Elsevier)
3. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)
4. Web of Science
5. ClinicalTrials.gov
6. WHO VigiBase
7. VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System)
8. Grey literature: WHO Technical Reports, CDC publications

**Additional Search Methods:**
- Reference lists of included studies
- Citation tracking of key studies
- Expert consultation with vaccine safety epidemiologists
- Regulatory authority reports (FDA, EMA, WHO)

**Date Limits:** 2020-present (COVID-19 vaccine era, booster introductions)

**Language:** English only

## Selection Process and Data Collection

### Screening Process
- Two-stage screening: title/abstract then full-text
- Two independent reviewers for each stage
- Kappa statistic calculated for inter-rater agreement
- Discrepancies resolved by third reviewer

### Data Extraction
- Standardized data extraction form
- Dual extraction with reconciliation
- Study characteristics, population details, intervention specifics
- Outcome measures with numerator/denominator data
- Risk of bias assessments

---

## Quantitative Synthesis (Meta-Analysis)

### Analysis Methodology
- **Primary Analysis:** Random-effects meta-analysis using inverse variance weighting
- **Effect Measure:** Risk ratios (RR) for binary outcomes with 95% confidence intervals
- **Statistical Software:** R (meta package), Stata (metan command)
- **Heterogeneity:** I² statistic and τ² for between-study variance

### Subgroup Analyses
1. By vaccine type: COVID-19 vs influenza vs HPV
2. By vaccine platform: mRNA vs viral vector vs adjuvanted vs viral
3. By age group: pediatric (<18), adult (18-64), elderly (≥65)
4. By booster number: 3rd dose vs 4th+ doses
5. By safety outcome type: local vs systemic vs serious adverse events

### Sensitivity Analyses
- One-study-removed analysis
- High-risk-of-bias studies excluded
- Influence of regulatory database studies
- Alternative effect measures (risk difference, odds ratio)

### Bias Assessment
- **Publication Bias:** Funnel plots, Egger's test, trim-and-fill analysis
- **Study Quality:** Cochrane ROB 2.0 and ROBINS-I tools
- **Small Study Effects:** Begg's correlation test, Peters test
