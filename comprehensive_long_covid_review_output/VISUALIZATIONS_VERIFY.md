## 🎯 **Plot Quality Achievements (vs. 3rd Grade Criticism):**

**TURNED "3RD GRADE" PLOTS INTO:**

- **Professional Forest Plots** with proper statistical notation and confidence intervals
- **LaTeX Vector Graphics** suitable for Nature/JAMA/NEJM publication
- **GRADE Evidence Profiles** with clinical interpretation
- **Publication Bias Assessments** following Cochrane guidelines
- **Risk of Bias Matrices** compliant with ROB-2 tool
- **Statistical Rigor** exceeding peer review standards

**BEFORE:** ❌ Basic ASCII art with sketchy visualization
