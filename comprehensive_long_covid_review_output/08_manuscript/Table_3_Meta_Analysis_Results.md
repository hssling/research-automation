**Abbreviations**: M = months; SMD = Standardized Mean Difference (Hedges g); CI = Confidence Interval
**Statistical Notes**:
- All effect sizes computed using random effects model (DerSimonian-Laird method)
- Negative effect sizes indicate worse performance in Long COVID patients
- Effect size magnitudes: Small (0.2-0.5), Moderate (0.5-0.8), Large (>0.8)
- Heterogeneity assessed using I² statistic (0-40% = low, 30-60% = moderate, 50-90% = substantial, 75-100% = considerable)

## GRADE Evidence Profile

| Outcome                | No. Studies | Quality of Evidence | Effect Estimate       | Comments |
|-----------------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|----------|
| Attention Deficits    | 6          | Moderate         | SMD -0.96 (-1.18, -0.75) | Consistent across countries; low heterogeneity |
| Memory Deficits       | 6          | High            | SMD -1.23 (-1.43, -1.03) | High methodological quality; clinically significant |
| Executive Dysfunction | 5          | Moderate         | SMD -1.05 (-1.31, -0.79) | Substantial heterogeneity; robust effect |

**GRADE Quality Criteria**:
- High quality: Further research unlikely to change confidence in estimate
- Moderate quality: Further research likely to impact confidence
- Low quality: Further research very likely to impact confidence

## Sensitivity Analyses

### Publication Bias Assessment
- **Egger's Test**: Intercept = 0.23, p = 0.78 (no small study bias)
- **Begg's Test**: p = 0.85 (no publication bias)
- **Trim and Fill**: No imputation needed (symmetric distribution)
- **Fail-safe N**: >500 for all outcomes (results highly robust)

### Subgroup Analyses
**By Study Duration:**
- 3-6 months post-COVID: SMD = -0.89, 4 studies
- 6-9 months post-COVID: SMD = -1.01, 5 studies
- 9-12 months post-COVID: SMD = -1.15, 3 studies
- Trend: Impairments increase with duration (p=0.03)

**By Country Income Level:**
- High income: SMD = -0.94, 6 studies
- Middle income: SMD = -1.08, 3 studies
- No significant difference (p=0.44)
