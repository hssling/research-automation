## Supplementary Methods

### Detailed Effect Size Calculation
Effect sizes were calculated as Hedges' g standardized mean difference:
- For studies reporting means and SDs: g = (M2 - M1) / √((SD1² + SD2²) / 2)
- Adjusted for small sample bias: g_corrected = g × (1 - 3/(4(df) - 1))
- When only t-scores or p-values available: Standard formulas were applied

### Heterogeneity Assessment
- Q statistic: χ² test for heterogeneity (df = k-1, k=studies)
- I² statistic: Proportion of total variance due to between-study variance
- τ²: Absolute between-study variance estimate

### Publication Bias Diagnostics
- Egger's regression: Linear regression of standardized effect vs precision
- Begg's test: Rank correlation of funnel plot asymmetry
- Trim-and-fill: Iterative method to identify missing studies
- Fail-safe N: Rosenthal's method estimating required null studies

### GRADE Evidence Profile Calculation
- Risk of bias: Assessed per Cochrane ROB-2 tool
- Inconsistency: I² >50% or p(Q)<0.10 suggests inconsistency
- Indirectness: Differences between target population and included studies
- Imprecision: Wide confidence intervals or small sample size
- Publication bias: Evidence from funnel plot asymmetry tests
