# Tobacco Control Policies and Lung Cancer Mortality Research Package

## **Research Question:**
### **Do stricter national tobacco control scores (WHO FCTC index) correlate with lower lung cancer mortality at the population level?**

---

## **1. Study Design and Background**

### **1.1 Public Health Context**

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, accounting for nearly 1.8 million deaths annually. Tobacco use is the primary cause, contributing to 85% of all lung cancer cases. Despite the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) implementation since 2005, tobacco-related mortality continues to burden healthcare systems globally.

The World Health Organization's FCTC represents the first global health treaty, with 181 parties committed to implementing comprehensive tobacco control policies including price increases, smoke-free laws, marketing bans, health warnings, and cessation support.

### **1.2 Research Rationale**

This multi-country ecological study will provide crucial evidence on the effectiveness of national tobacco control policy implementation in reducing lung cancer mortality burden. The analysis will:
- Quantify the association between FCTC implementation scores and lung cancer mortality
- Identify effective policy combinations for rapid mortality reduction
- Provide evidence for strengthening tobacco control globally
- Generate economic justification for tobacco control investments

### **1.3 Epidemiology Framework**

#### **Causal Pathway Model:**

```
________________________________________________________________________________
TOBACCO USE → TOBACCO CONTROL POLICIES → LUNG CANCER MORTALITY REDUCTION
________________________________________________________________________________
Epidemiological Link    Biological Mechanism    Policy Intervention    Expected Impact
________________________________________________________________________________
Tobacco Initiation      Cultural/behavioral     Marketing restrictions  ↓20-35% reduction
                        acceptance              and advertising bans

Tobacco Cessation       Nicotine dependence     Cessation programs       ↓15-25% reduction
                        and withdrawal          and nicotine replacement

Exposure Reduction      Passive smoking         Smoke-free laws          ↓5-15% reduction
                        and secondhand smoke    in public and workplace

Health Warnings         Risk awareness          Pictorial warnings       ↓10-20% reduction
                        and behavioral change   and plain packaging

Price Control          Affordability access    Tax increases            ↓30-45% reduction
                       to tobacco products      and inflation adjustments
