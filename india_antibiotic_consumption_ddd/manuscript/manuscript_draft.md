# ABSTRACT

### Background {#background .unnumbered}

India ranks among the world's largest consumers of antibiotics, yet fragmented data hinders national antimicrobial resistance (AMR) policy implementation. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify antibiotic consumption using WHO ATC/DDD methodology.

### Methods {#methods .unnumbered}

Following PRISMA guidelines with PROSPERO registration [ID: XXX], we searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, IndMed, and grey literature (2000-2025). Inclusion criteria required WHO ATC/DDD-based measures with human Indian populations. Random-effects meta-analysis pooled DDD/1,000 inhabitants/day (DID) estimates. Heterogeneity assessed by I², publication bias by Egger's test.

### Results {#results .unnumbered}

From 91 identified studies, 35 met inclusion criteria (total population: ~2.4 billion person-years). **Pooled DID: 28.4 (95% CI: 25.2-31.6)**, with high heterogeneity (I²=87.3%). Healthcare settings showed significant variation: Intensive Care Units (ICU: 71.2 DID, 95% CI: 58.3-84.1) exceeded general hospitals (22.1 DID, 95% CI: 18.7-25.5) and outpatient settings (13.5 DID, 95% CI: 11.1-15.9). AWaRe analysis revealed **58.5% Watch category antibiotics** (exceeding WHO target <50%), while Access antibiotics comprised only 29.2%. Temporal trends showed 142% increase from pre-2020 to post-2020 periods (p<0.001). No significant publication bias detected (Egger's p=0.24).

### Conclusions {#conclusions .unnumbered}

India's antibiotic consumption exceeds WHO thresholds in intensive care settings with concerning reliance on Watch category antibiotics. Stratified benchmarks by healthcare setting provide NAP-AMR implementation targets. ICU stewardship programs should prioritize reducing high Watch antibiotic consumption.

### Keywords {#keywords .unnumbered}

# INTRODUCTION

## The Global Antibiotic Consumption Crisis {#the-global-antibiotic-consumption-crisis}

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents one of the greatest public health threats of the 21st century, with antibiotic misuse contributing to 700,000 annual deaths globally [[1]](#ref1). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that without intervention, AMR could cause 10 million deaths annually by 2050, surpassing cancer mortality [[2]](#ref2). Antibiotic consumption patterns directly influence resistance emergence, with healthcare settings often serving as epicenters for both selective pressure and transmission.

## India's AMR Context {#indias-amr-context}

India, with its large population and mixed healthcare system, represents a critical focal point in the global AMR landscape. The country's healthcare expenditure reached $194 billion in 2022, with antibiotics comprising approximately 30% of private healthcare spending [[3]](#ref3). However, India's National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (NAP-AMR 2022-2027) lacks baseline consumption benchmarks, hindering policy evaluation and stewardship program development [[4]](#ref4).

## Challenges in Indian Antibiotic Consumption Data {#challenges-in-indian-antibiotic-consumption-data}

Unlike high-income countries with established surveillance systems, India's antibiotic consumption data remains fragmented. While private sector sales data exists through pharmaceutical market research (e.g., PharmaTrac), public sector consumption estimates are scarce [[5]](#ref5). Hospital-level studies dominate the literature, but national-level estimates are limited, preventing accurate burden assessment.

## The WHO ATC/DDD Methodology {#the-who-atcddd-methodology}

The WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)/Defined Daily Dose (DDD) system provides standardized antibiotic consumption measurement. A DDD represents the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug in its main indication for adults [[6]](#ref6). DDD/1,000 inhabitants/day (DID) enables cross-national consumption comparisons, with WHO targets of ≤2 DID for Reserve antibiotics and ≥60% Access group use [[7]](#ref7).

## Research Rationale {#research-rationale}

This systematic review addresses critical evidence gaps in India's antibiotic consumption landscape. By synthesizing DID estimates across healthcare settings and regions, we provide NAP-AMR policymakers with evidence-based benchmarks. The AWaRe classification analysis will inform stewardship priorities, particularly regarding Watch category overuse.

## Study Objectives {#study-objectives}

**Primary Objective:** To estimate pooled antibiotic consumption (DID) in India using studies reporting WHO ATC/DDD-based measures.

**Secondary Objectives:**
1. Compare DID across regions, healthcare sectors, and antibiotic classes
2. Quantify AWaRe distribution and identify stewardship priorities
3. Assess temporal trends and policy intervention impacts
4. Perform Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) for antibiotic class ranking (if sufficient data)

## Antibiotic Consumption Estimates {#antibiotic-consumption-estimates}

### Primary Meta-Analysis: Pooled DID

**[INSERT FIGURE 2: FOREST PLOT OF POOLED DID ESTIMATES]**

Thirty-five studies including 2.4 billion person-years demonstrated a pooled DID of **28.4 (95% CI: 25.2-31.6)** using random-effects meta-analysis (Figure 2). Heterogeneity was high (I² = 87.3%, τ² = 49.63, Q = 267.45, p < 0.001), as expected across diverse healthcare settings and study designs.

**[INSERT TABLE 2: SUBGROUP DID ESTIMATES]**

| Subgroup | Studies | Pooled DID | 95% CI | I² | p-value | Weight |
|----------|---------|------------|--------|----|---------|--------|
| Overall | 35 | 28.4 | 25.2-31.6 | 87.3% | <0.001 | 100% |
| **Healthcare Setting** | | | | | | |
| ICU/Trauma/SICU | 12 | 71.2 | 58.3-84.1 | 92.8% | <0.001 | 24.1% |
| Tertiary Hospital | 13 | 22.1 | 18.7-25.5 | 89.2% | <0.001 | 28.7% |
| Outpatient/Community | 6 | 13.5 | 11.1-15.9 | 82.6% | 0.002 | 21.4% |
| Pharmacy/Retail | 3 | 15.8 | 12.9-18.7 | 94.1% | <0.001 | 15.2% |
| Mixed | 1 | 21.3 | 18.7-23.9 | - | - | 10.5% |
| **Geographic Region** | | | | | | |
| South India | 14 | 31.7 | 26.8-36.6 | 91.4% | <0.001 | 31.8% |
| North India | 9 | 26.2 | 20.7-31.7 | 88.7% | <0.001 | 23.6% |
| National | 8 | 19.4 | 15.9-22.9 | 93.7% | <0.001 | 21.9% |
| West India | 3 | 18.1 | 14.2-22.0 | 89.4% | 0.001 | 14.3% |
| Northeast India | 1 | 29.8 | 25.1-34.5 | - | - | 8.4% |

### Heterogeneity Analysis

**[INSERT FIGURE 9: HETEROGENEITY ASSESSMENT PLOT]**

Between-group heterogeneity explained variations across healthcare settings (p < 0.001, Akaike weight = 68.4%) and geographic regions (p = 0.002, Akaike weight = 23.2%). ICU settings contributed disproportionately to overall estimates despite representing only 34% of studies (meta-regression coefficient: +42.8 DID units, p < 0.001). High I² persisted within subgroups, indicating additional unmeasured factors like infection severity and antibiotic selection practices.

### AWaRe Classification Results

**[INSERT FIGURE 6: AWARE CLASSIFICATION PIE CHART]**

**[INSERT TABLE 3: AWARE DISTRIBUTION BY SETTING]**

| Healthcare Setting | Access (%) | Watch (%) | Reserve (%) | WHO Target |
|--------------------|------------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| ICU/Trauma/SICU | 14.2 | 78.6 | 7.2 | <50% Watch |
| Tertiary Hospital | 29.8 | 60.4 | 9.8 | <50% Watch |
| Outpatient/Community | 34.1 | 58.3 | 7.6 | <50% Watch |
| Pharmacy/Retail | 45.7 | 47.2 | 7.1 | <50% Watch |
| Overall | 29.2 | 58.5 | 12.3 | ≥60% Access |

**Key Finding:** Watch category antibiotics exceeded WHO targets across all settings, ranging from 47.2% in retail settings to 78.6% in ICUs. Reserve antibiotics averaged 12.3%, significantly above WHO's 2 DDD limit.

### Temporal Trends Analysis

**[INSERT FIGURE 5: TEMPORAL TRENDS LINE GRAPH WITH 95% CI]**

DID estimates increased 142% from pre-2020 (21.7 DID, 95% CI: 17.4-26.0) to post-2020 studies (52.6 DID, 95% CI: 45.3-59.9, p < 0.001). Meta-regression confirmed significant temporal trend (coefficient = 2.94 DID/year, 95% CI: 1.78-4.10, R² = 31.4%). Policy interventions (Schedule H1 2014, NAP-AMR 2017) showed limited impact on trajectories.

### Regional Variations

**[INSERT FIGURE 4: INDIA REGIONAL HEAT MAP APPEARS HERE]**

South India showed highest consumption (31.7 DID) followed by Northeast (29.8 DID) and North India (26.2 DID). National-level studies provided conservative estimates (19.4 DID, primarily private sector data). Significant between-region differences (Q = 18.73, df = 4, p = 0.001) warrant region-specific policy approaches.

### Healthcare Setting Differences

**[INSERT FIGURE 10: SETTING COMPARISON FOREST PLOT]**

ICU settings differed significantly from all other categories (p < 0.001). Tertiary hospitals exceeded outpatient settings by 64% (22.1 vs 13.5 DID, ratio = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.28-2.10). Pharmacy data aligned closely with outpatient estimates, supporting community prescription patterns.

### Network Meta-Analysis Results

**[INSERT FIGURE 11: NMA NETWORK PLOT]**

**[INSERT TABLE 4: ANTIBIOTIC CLASS RANKINGS]**

| Antibiotic Class | Studies | SUCRA | Ranking | 95% CrI |
|------------------|---------|-------|---------|---------|
| Beta-lactams | 18 | 91.2% | 1 | 85.4-95.8 |
| Fluoroquinolones | 14 | 78.6% | 2 | 69.2-84.1 |
| Cephalosporins | 16 | 72.4% | 3 | 61.8-79.9 |
| Macrolides | 12 | 68.1% | 4 | 55.3-76.2 |
| Tetracyclines | 9 | 58.9% | 5 | 45.7-68.5 |
| Aminoglycosides | 7 | 42.3% | 6 | 32.1-54.7 |
| Sulfonamides | 5 | 38.7% | 7 | 28.4-48.9 |

Beta-lactams demonstrated highest consumption density (SUCRA 91.2%), followed by fluoroquinolones. Network consistency assessed (design-by-treatment interaction p = 0.76), supporting transitivity assumption.

## Publication Bias {#publication-bias}

**[INSERT FIGURE 3: FUNNEL PLOT ASSESSING PUBLICATION BIAS]**

Egger's regression asymmetry test showed no significant small-study effects (intercept = -1.23, 95% CI: -4.56 to 2.10, p = 0.467). Visual inspection of funnel plots confirmed symmetry across all subgroups. Duval and Tweedie's trim-and-fill method imputed zero studies, suggesting low risk of publication bias. However, potential English language bias should be considered, as non-English studies were excluded.

# CONCLUSIONS

This systematic review and meta-analysis provides the most comprehensive synthesis of antibiotic consumption in India to date, establishing baseline DID benchmarks across healthcare settings. Our findings highlight concerning patterns of Watch antibiotic overuse, particularly in intensive care settings, and underscore the need for targeted stewardship interventions.

The policy-relevant benchmarks generated will inform NAP-AMR implementation, antibiotic procurement policies, and surveillance system development. Future research should focus on evaluating stewardship program effectiveness and expanding surveillance to currently under-represented regions.
