# Research Questions & Answers: Antibiotic Consumption in India (DDD-Based Meta-Analysis)

This document outlines the key research questions for the systematic review and meta-analysis of antibiotic consumption in India using WHO ATC/DDD methodology. Each question is addressed with context, rationale, and planned methodology based on the PICO/PEO framework.

## PRIMARY RESEARCH QUESTION 1
**What is the pooled antibiotic consumption (DDD/1,000 inhabitants/day or DID) in India based on WHO ATC/DDD methodology across healthcare settings and regions?**

**Context & Rationale:** This primary question addresses the core objective of benchmarking antibiotic use in India, where high consumption rates contribute to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Current literature shows fragmented DDD estimates, with inter-state variations and policy impacts (e.g., Schedule H1).

**POPULATION:** Indian populations (community, hospital, or pharmacy-level data)  
**EXPOSURE:** Antibiotic consumption measured via standardized WHO ATC/DDD system  
**OUTCOME:** Pooled DID estimates with 95% confidence intervals  
**DESIGN:** Meta-analysis of observational studies (cross-sectional, surveillance, database analyses)

**Planned Methodology & Answer:** Conduct random-effects meta-analysis pooling DID values from included studies. Expected heterogeneity (I² >75%) due to regional diversity. Subgroup analyses by setting and region. Target: 30-50 studies for robust evidence.

**Expected Answer:** Pooled DID ~15-25 per region/state (conservative estimate based on global burdens). Will quantify with forest plots and assess temporal changes.

## SECONDARY RESEARCH QUESTION 2
**How does the distribution of antibiotic consumption by AWaRe categories (Access, Watch, Reserve) vary across settings and regions in India?**

**Context & Rationale:** AWaRe classification (WHO Essential Medicines) categorizes antibiotics by resistance risk. Access antibiotics should dominate (≥60% globally), but India's high Watch category use (fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins) drives AMR. Changes expected post-NAP-AMR 2017-2021.

**POPULATION:** Same as above  
**EXPOSURE:** ATC-coded antibiotic consumption  
**OUTCOME:** Percentage distribution by AWaRe category  
**DESIGN:** Proportional meta-analysis or frequency analysis

**Planned Methodology & Answer:** Extract AWaRe data from studies, calculate weighted proportions. Use meta-analysis for pooled percentages with confidence intervals. Visualize with pie/bar charts by region.

**Expected Answer:** Watch category likely 40-60% nationally (higher in private settings), Access 30-45%, Reserve <10%. Northeast/city settings may show higher Reserve use due to multidrug-resistant infections.

## SECONDARY RESEARCH QUESTION 3
**What are the regional variations in DID estimates across India's five administrative regions (North, South, East, West, Northeast)?**

**Context & Rationale:** India's regional diversity affects antibiotic access and prescribing patterns. Southern states (e.g., Kerala) often show higher consumption due to better healthcare access, while northern states may have different cultural prescribing norms.

**POPULATION:** Regional Indian populations  
**EXPOSURE:** Healthcare setting-specific antibiotic use  
**OUTCOME:** DID estimates by region with subgroup analysis  
**DESIGN:** Subgroup meta-analysis

**Planned Methodology & Answer:** Stratify pooled DID by region in meta-analysis. Perform between-group heterogeneity tests. Include meta-regression on socio-economic indicators (income, urbanization).

**Expected Answer:** South India: 15-25 DID, North India: 10-20 DID, East/West: variable 10-20 DID, Northeast: lowest <15 DID. Test for statistical differences (p<0.05).

## SECONDARY RESEARCH QUESTION 4
**What is the impact of healthcare sector (public vs. private) on antibiotic consumption patterns as measured by DID?**

**Context & Rationale:** India's dual healthcare system shows different prescribing behaviors. Private sector often over-prescribes broad-spectrum antibiotics (higher Watch/Reserve), while public sector follows standardized protocols. Irrational use in private pharmacies contributes to AMR.

**POPULATION:** Healthcare facility or pharmacy users  
**EXPOSURE:** Sector-specific prescribing patterns  
**OUTCOME:** Comparative DID ratios (public vs. private)  
**DESIGN:** Subgroup meta-analysis with ratio measures

**Planned Methodology & Answer:** Subgroup analysis comparing DID in public vs. private settings. Calculate ratio of means or use forest plots for visualization. Assess interaction between region and sector.

**Expected Answer:** Private sector DID likely 1.5-2x higher than public (based on global evidence). Statistically significant difference (p<0.05) with higher Watch antibiotic use in private.

## SECONDARY RESEARCH QUESTION 5
**What temporal trends in DID estimates have occurred from 2000 to 2025, and how do they correlate with AMR policy changes (e.g., Schedule H1 2014, NLEM updates)?**

**Context & Rationale:** India's antimicrobial stewardship policies evolved from 2010 onwards. Schedule H1 restricted antibiotics, NLEM updates affected formularies, and NAP-AMR monitoring began in 2017. Understanding trends informs future policy evaluation.

**POPULATION:** Indian populations across time periods  
**EXPOSURE:** Policy eras (pre/post major reforms)  
**OUTCOME:** Trend analysis of DID over time  
**DESIGN:** Meta-regression stratified by policy periods

**Planned Methodology & Answer:** Perform meta-regression with publication year as predictor. Categorize studies by policy eras for subgroup comparison. Use bubble plots for visualization.

**Expected Answer:** Likely increasing trend pre-2014 (10-15 DID), stable/plateau post-2014 (15-20 DID). Positive correlation with economic growth but negative with policy implementation strength.

## SECONDARY RESEARCH QUESTION 6
**Which antibiotic classes show the highest consumption, and can Network Meta-Analysis rank them by relative use density?**

**Context & Rationale:** Beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides dominate globally, but India's cephalosporin overuse contrasts with some countries. Ranking helps identify stewardship priorities.

**POPULATION:** Same across classes  
**EXPOSURE:** Different antibiotic classes (ATC codes)  
**OUTCOME:** SUCRA rankings for consumption density  
**DESIGN:** Network meta-analysis (if ≥10 studies report class-level data)

**Planned Methodology & Answer:** If sufficient multi-arm studies, perform NMA using random-effects consistency model. Generate SUCRA values and ranking plots. Otherwise, descriptive ranking by pooled proportions.

**Expected Answer:** Top classes: Beta-lactams (cephalosporins/penicillins ~40%), Fluoroquinolones (~25%), Macrolides (~15%). Carbapenems rank high in Reserve category. SUCRA: Beta-lactams highest if NMA feasible.

## SECONDARY RESEARCH QUESTION 7
**What is the methodological quality of included studies, and how does it affect DID estimates?**

**Context & Rationale:** DDD studies vary in rigor; WHO ATC compliance and sampling methods impact validity. Quality assessment ensures reliability of pooled estimates.

**POPULATION:** Study-level characteristics  
**EXPOSURE:** Methodological quality scores  
**OUTCOME:** Quality-stratified DID estimates  
**DESIGN:** Sensitivity analysis and meta-regression

**Planned Methodology & Answer:** Use STROBE checklist and WHO ATC criteria for quality scoring. Perform sensitivity analyses excluding low-quality studies. Meta-regression on quality score.

**Expected Answer:** Moderate overall quality (STROBE 15-18/22). High-quality studies show more conservative DID estimates. No major bias introduced by quality.

## EXPLORATORY RESEARCH QUESTION 8
**How do socio-economic factors (income level, urbanization, GDP per capita) moderate antibiotic consumption in India?**

**Context & Rationale:** Higher income correlates with higher antibiotic use globally, but India's mixed economy shows contrasting patterns across states.

**POPULATION:** India-wide with varying socio-economic profiles  
**EXPOSURE:** Socio-economic indicators by state/region  
**OUTCOME:** Moderated DID estimates  
**DESIGN:** Meta-regression or ecological analysis

**Planned Methodology & Answer:** If sufficient studies, include socio-economic variables in meta-regression model. Use state-level data from Census/National Health Accounts.

**Expected Answer:** Positive moderate correlation with urbanization (ρ=0.4-0.6) and income, but attenuated by access disparities. Rural areas may show different patterns.
