# Antibiotic Consumption in India: DDD-Based Meta-Analysis Project

This project implements a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of antibiotic consumption in India using WHO ATC/DDD methodology, focusing on Defined Daily Dose (DDD)/1,000 inhabitants/day (DID) metrics across different healthcare settings and regions.

## Project Overview

### Research Question
What is the pooled antibiotic consumption (DID) in India based on WHO ATC/DDD methodology, and how does it vary across regions, healthcare sectors, and antibiotic classes?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Systematic review and meta-analysis with Network Meta-Analysis (NMA)
- **Scope:** India-specific studies (2000–2025) reporting ATC/DDD data
- **Outcome:** DDD/1,000 inhabitants/day (DID) and AWaRe distribution
- **Software:** R (meta, metafor, netmeta), STATA (alternative)

### Expected Outputs
1. **PROSPERO Registration:** Ready-to-upload form
2. **PRISMA Manuscript:** Complete systematic review
3. **Forest Plots:** Pooled DID estimates with heterogeneity
4. **Subgroup Analyses:** By region, setting, AWaRe category
5. **Meta-Regression:** Temporal trends and policy impacts
6. **NMA Results:** Antibiotic class rankings (if feasible)

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Literature Search & Screening
1. Execute searches in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, IndMed, WHO IRIS
2. Grey literature: NCDC/ICMR, Google Scholar, conferences
3. Screen titles/abstracts → full texts → data extraction
4. Use Zotero/Rayyan for reference management

### Phase 2: Data Extraction & Quality Assessment
1. Extract DDD/DID values using standardized form
2. Assess WHO ATC compliance and STROBE criteria
3. Calculate SE from CIs or n (where missing)
4. Double-extraction for validation

### Phase 3: Statistical Analysis
1. **Meta-Analysis:** Random-effects model for DID pooling
2. **Heterogeneity:** I², τ², Cochran Q
3. **Publication Bias:** Egger's test, funnel plot
4. **Subgroups:** Region, setting, AWaRe, policy era
5. **Meta-Regression:** Year, region, covariates
6. **NMA (conditional):** Antibiotic classes ranking

### Phase 4: Manuscript & Dissemination
1. Write PRISMA-compliant manuscript
2. Create tables/figures for results
3. Submit to journals (e.g., JAC, BMC Infectious Diseases)
4. Present at conferences/policy forums

## Key Metrics & Classifications

### AWaRe Categories (WHO Essential Medicines)
- **Access:** First-/second-choice antibiotics
- **Watch:** Higher resistance potential, limited use
- **Reserve:** Last resort for multidrug-resistant infections

### Antibiotic Classes (ATC J01)
- β-lactams, Macrolides, Fluoroquinolones
- Tetracyclines, Aminoglycosides, Glycopeptides
- Sulfonamides, etc.

### Regional Classifications
- North, South, East, West, Northeast India

## R Packages Required

```r
install.packages(c("meta", "metafor", "netmeta", "dmetar",
                   "openxlsx", "ggplot2", "ggpubr", "readxl"))
```

### Analysis Workflow in R
1. Load data → Clean → Visualize distributions
2. Overall MA → Subgroups → Meta-regression
3. Publication bias checks → Sensitivity analyses
4. NMA (if multiple classes per study)
5. Export plots/tables → Generate manuscript figures

---

## Data Standards

### Input Data Format (Excel/CSV)
- Columns: study_id, year, region, setting, population, total_ddd, did_value, se, awa_cat, antibiotic_class, policy_phase

### Output Standards
- Forest plots: DID with 95% CI
- Funnel plots: For bias assessment
- AWaRe pie charts: Percentage distribution
- Bubble plots: Meta-regression results
- SUCRA plots: NMA rankings (if applicable)

---

## Quality Assurance

### Methodological Checks
- WHO ATC/DDD compliance assessment
- STROBE checklist for bias risk
- Inter-rater reliability (κ ≥ 0.8)
- Duplicate data entry validation

### Statistical Considerations
- Random-effects vs. fixed-effects sensitivity
- Outlier/ influential study identification
- Missing data imputation (if needed)
- Cross-validation with WHO GARIE data

---

## Policy Relevance

### NAP-AMR India (2022–2027)
- Targets: DDD benchmarking for surveillance
- AWaRe implementation monitoring
- Regional disparities in access/resistance

### Indicators for Monitoring
- National DID trends
- Private vs. public sector consumption
- Reserve antibiotic use patterns
- Policy intervention impact assessment

---

## Expected Challenges & Solutions

### Heterogeneity
- High I² expected due to regional variation
- Subgroup analyses to explain variability
- Meta-regression on known predictors

### Data Scarcity
- Grey literature mining (ICMR projects)
- International collaborations with WHO GARIE
- District-level pilot studies inclusion

### NMA Feasibility
- May need class aggregation (e.g., all β-lactams)
- Contrast-based vs. arm-based data handling
- Inconsistency assessments
