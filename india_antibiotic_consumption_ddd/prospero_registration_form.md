**Title of the review:**  
Antibiotic Consumption in India: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Defined Daily Dose (DDD)–Based Estimates across Healthcare Settings and Regions

**Review question(s):**  
1. What is the pooled antibiotic consumption (DDD/1,000 inhabitants/day or DID) in India based on WHO ATC/DDD methodology?  
2. How does DID vary across different regions in India?  
3. What is the distribution of antibiotic consumption by AWaRe categories (Access, Watch, Reserve)?  
4. What are the temporal trends in DID and the influence of policy changes?  
5. Which antibiotic classes are most consumed, and how do they rank in relative consumption (if sufficient data for NMA)?

**Review objectives:**  
1. Primary Objective: To estimate pooled antibiotic consumption (DID) in India using studies reporting WHO ATC/DDD-based measures.  
2. Secondary Objectives:  
   - Compare DID across regions, healthcare sectors, and antibiotic classes.  
   - Quantify the Access / Watch / Reserve (AWaRe) distribution.  
   - Conduct meta-regression for predictors (year, region, income, policy era).  
   - If sufficient class-level data are available, perform Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) to rank antibiotic classes by relative consumption and use density.

**Review eligibility criteria including participant types, interventions/exposures/comparators, outcomes, study types:**  
**Inclusion Criteria:**  
- **Population:** Human populations in India (community or facility level).  
- **Exposure:** Consumption of systemic antibiotics (ATC J01) measured via WHO ATC/DDD system.  
- **Outcome:** DDD/1,000 inhabitants/day (DID) and AWaRe distribution.  
- **Study Design:** Observational studies (cross-sectional, surveillance, or database analyses) reporting DDD data.  
- **Other:** Studies from India (national, state, or facility-based); reports antibiotic use in DDD, DID, or convertible measures; published 2000 – present.  

**Exclusion Criteria:**  
- Non-human studies, pediatric-only dosage reports without DDD equivalence.  
- Non-standard units (e.g., prescription counts without conversion data).  
- Non-Indian studies.

**Search strategy, including time period covered in the review:**  
Electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, IndMed, WHO IRIS, MoHFW Reports.  
Grey literature and unpublished data: NCDC/ICMR AMR Network.  
Key search terms: ("Antibiotic consumption" OR "antimicrobial use" OR "antibiotic utilization") AND ("Defined Daily Dose" OR DDD OR "ATC/DDD") AND (India OR Indian).  
Time period: January 2000 – December 2025 (searches ongoing).  
Language: English.  
No restrictions on study design beyond eligibility criteria.

**Describe any additional inclusion/exclusion criteria, if any.**  

**Data extraction (selection and coding):**  
Data will be extracted using a standardized form including: study design, region/state, setting (community, hospital, pharmacy, tertiary care), timeframe, denominator population, ATC codes, total DDD, DID values, AWaRe classification (Access, Watch, Reserve), methodological quality (STROBE/WHO ATC compliance).

**Risk of bias (quality) assessment:**  
Quality assessment will be conducted using: STROBE checklist for observational studies and WHO ATC compliance guidelines. Studies will be rated as low, moderate, or high risk of bias.

**Strategy for data synthesis:**  
- **Meta-analysis:** Random-effects model for pooling DID estimates (with 95% CI). Heterogeneity assessed by I², τ², Cochran Q.  
- **Subgroup analyses:** By region, healthcare sector (public/private), urban/rural.  
- **Meta-regression:** For predictors like publication year, setting, region, policy phase (e.g., Schedule H1, NLEM updates).  
- **Network Meta-Analysis (NMA):** If sufficient class-level data, random-effects consistency model to compare antibiotic subclasses (e.g., β-lactams, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, carbapenems) and derive SUCRA values for ranking.  
Publication bias assessed by Egger's test and funnel plot.  
Software: R (packages: meta, metafor, netmeta) or STATA (mvmeta).

**Analysis of subgroups or subsets:**  
Subgroups for pooling DID: Region (North, South, East, West, Northeast), Healthcare sector (public vs. private), Urban vs. rural, Antibiotic class, AWaRe category, Time period.

**Type and method of review:**  
Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (with potential NMA). Proactive registration in PROSPERO.

**Dissemination plans:**  
- Publication in peer-reviewed journal (e.g., Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, Plos One).  
- Presentation at conferences (e.g., ECCMID, INDICAS).  
- Dissemination to MoHFW/NCDC for policy input to NAP-AMR.
