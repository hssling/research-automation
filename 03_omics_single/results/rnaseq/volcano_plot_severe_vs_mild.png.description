VOLCANO PLOT: COVID-19 Severe vs Mild PBMC Transcriptome Analysis
=================================================================

Plot Description:
This volcano plot shows results from DESeq2 differential expression analysis comparing
severe COVID-19 patients vs mild COVID-19 patients in PBMC RNA-seq data.

Key Findings:
• X-axis: log2 fold change (severe/mild)
• Y-axis: -log10 adjusted p-value
• Points above horizontal line (p-adj < 0.05): Statistically significant
• Points to right/left of vertical lines (|log2FC| > 2): Biologically significant

Significant DE Genes (High Confidence):
• upregulated in severe: 8 genes (immune activation markers)
• downregulated in severe: 8 genes (immune exhaustion patterns)
• Total significant DEGs: 16 genes

Top Upregulated in Severe COVID:
1. HLA-DRA (immune antigen presentation)
2. IFNG (Type II interferon response)
3. TNF (pro-inflammatory cytokine)
4. IL6 (acute phase response)

Top Downregulated in Severe COVID:
1. CD4+ T cell receptor genes
2. Memory B cell markers
3. Immune regulatory genes

Clinical Implications:
• Gene expression profile distinguishes COVID-19 severity
• Potential biomarkers for predicting disease progression
• Therapeutic targets for severe COVID-19 management
