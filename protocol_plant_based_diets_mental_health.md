# Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocol: Plant-Based Diets and Mental Health Outcomes

## Title
Plant-Based Diets and Mental Health Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

## Background
Mental health disorders affect over 1 billion people worldwide, with depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline representing major public health challenges. Diet has emerged as a potentially modifiable risk factor for mental health, with plant-based diets receiving increasing attention due to their potential benefits for cardiovascular health, environmental sustainability, and chronic disease prevention.

However, the relationship between plant-based diets and mental health outcomes remains controversial. Some studies suggest benefits through improved micronutrient intake and reduced inflammation, while others raise concerns about potential nutrient deficiencies affecting brain function. The evidence is scattered across diverse populations and study designs, making synthesis challenging.

This systematic review will comprehensively evaluate the association between plant-based diets (including vegetarian, vegan, and plant-predominant diets) and mental health outcomes including depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline.

## Research Question
Do plant-based or vegetarian diets reduce the risk of depression, anxiety, or cognitive decline compared to omnivorous diets?

## Objectives
1. To systematically review evidence on the association between plant-based diets and mental health outcomes
2. To quantify the pooled effect sizes for key mental health outcomes using meta-analysis
3. To assess heterogeneity and identify sources of variability across studies
4. To evaluate the quality and bias of included studies
5. To provide recommendations for future research and clinical practice

## Methods

### Eligibility Criteria

#### Participants
- Adults aged ≥18 years
- General population, clinical populations, or specific subgroups (e.g., vegetarians)
- No geographic restrictions

#### Interventions/Exposure
- Plant-based diets defined as:
  - Vegetarian (lacto-ovo, lacto, ovo, or vegan)
  - Plant-predominant diets (≥70% plant-based foods)
  - Dietary patterns with high intake of plant foods
- Comparator: Omnivorous diets (regular meat consumption)

#### Outcomes

**Primary Outcomes:**
- **Depression:** Diagnosed depression (clinical diagnosis, validated scales like PHQ-9, CES-D, MADRS)
- **Anxiety:** Diagnosed anxiety disorders or validated anxiety scales (GAD-7, HARS)
- **Cognitive decline/dementia:** Cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, or cognitive function assessed by validated instruments

**Secondary Outcomes:**
- **Mental health composite scores** (depression + anxiety)
- **Mood/anxiety symptoms** (subthreshold symptoms not meeting diagnostic criteria)
- **Cognitive function** (measured by neuropsychological testing)
- **Quality of life** (mental health-related quality of life measures)

#### Study Designs
- **Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)** of dietary interventions
- **Cohort studies** (prospective and retrospective)
- **Case-control studies**
- **Cross-sectional studies**
- **Nested case-control studies**

### Information Sources and Search Strategy

#### Electronic Databases
- PubMed/MEDLINE
- EMBASE
- Cochrane CENTRAL
- PsycINFO
- Web of Science
- Scopus
- CINAHL

#### Search Terms
(("plant-based diet" OR "plant based diet" OR vegetarian* OR vegan* OR "vegetarian diet" OR "vegan diet" OR "plant predominant diet") AND (depression OR anxiety OR "mental health" OR cognition OR cognitive OR dementia OR Alzheimer* OR "mild cognitive impairment" OR MCI OR "mental disorders"))

#### Date Range
- Publication date: January 1, 2000 - present
- No language restrictions (English abstracts required)

#### Additional Sources
- Grey literature: WHO reports, dietary guidelines
- Reference lists of included studies
- Citation tracking of key systematic reviews

### Study Selection Process
1. **Title/abstract screening** by two independent reviewers
2. **Full-text review** by two independent reviewers
3. **Disagreement resolution** by third reviewer or consensus
4. **Data quality verification** for all included studies

### Data Extraction
Standardized forms will capture:
- **Study characteristics:** Design, sample size, setting, follow-up duration
- **Participant characteristics:** Age, sex, baseline diet, comorbidities
- **Exposure details:** Diet type, duration, assessment method, adherence measures
- **Outcome measures:** Diagnostic criteria, assessment tools, follow-up periods
- **Risk estimates:** Odds ratios, risk ratios, hazard ratios, mean differences with 95% confidence intervals
- **Covariates:** Adjustment variables (age, sex, education, socioeconomic status, physical activity, etc.)

### Risk of Bias Assessment

#### RCTs
- Cochrane RoB 2 tool for randomized trials

#### Cohort/Case-Control Studies
- Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS)

#### Cross-Sectional Studies
- Adapted NOS criteria for cross-sectional designs

Studies with high risk of bias will be excluded.

### Data Synthesis

#### Meta-Analysis Methods
- **Random-effects meta-analysis** using restricted maximum likelihood estimation
- **Effect measures:** Odds ratios for binary outcomes, standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes
- **Pooled estimates** with 95% confidence intervals
- **Heterogeneity assessment:** I² statistic (>50% = substantial), χ² test (p<0.10)
- **Publication bias:** Funnel plots, Egger's regression, trim-and-fill method

#### Subgroup Analyses
- By study design (RCT vs observational)
- By diet type (vegan vs vegetarian vs plant-predominant)
- By mental health outcome (depression vs anxiety vs cognition)
- By population characteristics (age, sex, baseline health status)
- By follow-up duration (<1 year vs ≥1 year)

#### Sensitivity Analyses
- Exclusion of low-quality studies (NOS <7)
- Exclusion of studies with self-reported dietary assessment only
- Fixed-effects model as alternative

### Certainty of Evidence
- GRADE framework for assessing confidence in pooled estimates
- Consideration of study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias

### Statistical Software
- R (metafor, dmetar, netmeta packages)
- Stata for supplementary analyses
- Review Manager (RevMan) for forest plots

## Expected Results
This systematic review will provide the most comprehensive synthesis to date of plant-based diets and mental health outcomes, addressing key controversies in nutrition-psychiatry literature.
