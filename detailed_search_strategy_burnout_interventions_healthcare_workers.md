# Detailed Search Strategy: Burnout Interventions for Healthcare Workers

## Search Question
What is the comparative effectiveness of digital interventions (apps, teletherapy, mindfulness platforms) versus traditional in-person methods (group therapy, workshops, individual counseling) in reducing burnout in healthcare workers?

## Research Question Components
- **Population:** Healthcare workers (physicians, nurses, therapists, technicians)
- **Intervention:** Digital mental health interventions (apps, teletherapy platforms)
- **Comparator:** In-person interventions (group therapy, workshops, counseling)
- **Outcome:** Burnout reduction (Maslach Burnout Inventory, emotional exhaustion, depersonalization)
- **Study Design:** RCTs, non-randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies

## Search Strategy Development

### Step 1: Concept Identification
1. **Burnout/occupational stress** (burnout, professional burnout, occupational stress)
2. **Healthcare workers** (healthcare worker, physician, nurse, clinician, therapist)
3. **Digital interventions** (mobile app, smartphone application, teletherapy, online platform)
4. **In-person interventions** (group therapy, workshop, counseling, face-to-face)
5. **Outcome measures** (burnout inventory, emotional exhaustion, depersonalization)

### Step 2: Keyword Mapping
Systematic term expansion for comprehensive capture.
