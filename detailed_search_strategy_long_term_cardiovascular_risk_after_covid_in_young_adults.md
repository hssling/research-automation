# Detailed Search Strategy: Long-Term Cardiovascular Risk After COVID-19 in Young Adults

## Search Question
What is the pooled risk of cardiovascular outcomes (myocarditis, arrhythmia, thromboembolism) among young adults (<40 years) with prior COVID-19 infection compared to controls?

## Research Question Components
- **Population:** Young adults aged 18-39 years
- **Exposure/Intervention:** SARS-CoV-2 infection (confirmed COVID-19)
- **Comparison:** Non-COVID-19 individuals (controls)
- **Outcomes:** Cardiovascular complications (myocarditis, arrhythmias, thromboembolic events)
- **Study Types:** Cohort studies, registries, case-control studies

## Search Strategy Development

### Step 1: Concept Identification
1. **COVID-19/ SARS-CoV-2** (Multiple variants: coronavirus, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2)
2. **Population Terms** (young adults: adolescent, adult, age 18-40, under 40, youth)
3. **Cardiovascular Outcomes** (heart, cardiac, cardiovascular, myocarditis, arrhythmia, thromboembolism, thrombosis)
4. **Study Design** (cohort, risk, longitudinal, follow-up)
5. **Long-term** (long-term, follow-up, prospective, retrospective)

### Step 2: Keyword Mapping
Constructing search strings for each database with platform-specific syntax.

```

### EMBASE Search Strategy
EMBASE uses different field tags and syntax.

```
#1: 'covid 19':ti,ab OR 'sars cov 2':ti,ab OR coronavirus:ti,ab OR covid:ti,ab
#2: myocarditis:ti,ab OR arrhythmia:ti,ab OR arrhythmias:ti,ab OR 'atrial fibrillation':ti,ab OR 'ventricular arrhythmias':ti,ab OR thromboembolism:ti,ab OR thrombosis:ti,ab OR embolism:ti,ab OR thrombotic:ti,ab OR 'cardiovascular disease':ti,ab OR 'heart disease':ti,ab OR 'cardiac complications':ti,ab
#3: 'young adult':ti,ab OR adult:ti,ab OR adults:ti,ab OR adolescence:ti,ab OR adolescent:ti,ab OR youth:ti,ab OR '18-40':ti,ab OR 'under 40':ti,ab OR 'age 18-39':ti,ab
#4: cohort:ti,ab OR prospective:ti,ab OR retrospective:ti,ab OR longitudinal:ti,ab OR follow-up:ti,ab OR risk:ti,ab OR registry:ti,ab OR 'population based':ti,ab OR 'electronic health record':ti,ab
#5: #1 AND #2 AND #3 AND #4
```

### Cochrane Library Search Strategy
```

#2: (COVID-19 or coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2 or COVID):ti,ab,kw
#3: #1 or #2
#4: MeSH descriptor: [Myocarditis] explode all trees
#5: MeSH descriptor: [Arrhythmias, Cardiac] explode all trees
#6: MeSH descriptor: [Thromboembolism] explode all trees
#7: (myocarditis or arrhythmia* or arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias or thromboembolism* or thrombosis or embolism* or thrombotic* or cardiovascular disease or heart disease or cardiac complications):ti,ab,kw
#8: #4 or #5 or #6 or #7
#9: (young adult or adults or adult or adolescence or adolescent or youth or "18-40" or "under 40" or "age 18-39"):ti,ab,kw
#10: (cohort or prospective or retrospective or longitudinal or follow-up or risk or registry or population-based or electronic health record):ti,ab,kw
#11: #3 and #8 and #9 and #10
```

### Web of Science Search Strategy
Web of Science uses field tags differently.

```
TI=((COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR coronavirus OR COVID) AND (myocarditis OR arrhythmia* OR thromboembol* OR thrombosis OR cardiovascul* OR heart OR cardiac) AND (young adult OR adult OR adolescent OR youth OR "18-40" OR "under 40")) AND TS=(cohort OR prospective OR retrospective OR longitudinal OR follow-up OR risk OR registry OR "population-based" OR "electronic health")
```

### Scopus Search Strategy
```
TITLE-ABS-KEY((COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR coronavirus OR COVID) AND (myocarditis OR arrhythmia* OR thromboembol* OR thrombosis OR cardiovascul* OR heart OR cardiac) AND (young adult OR adult OR adolescent OR youth OR "18-40" OR "under 40") AND (cohort OR prospective OR retrospective OR longitudinal OR follow-up OR risk OR registry OR population-based OR "electronic health"))
