## Abstract

### Background
Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic pain condition with unclear etiology. Emerging evidence suggests gut microbiome dysbiosis may contribute to disease pathogenesis through inflammatory and neurological pathways.

### Methods
This systematic review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for studies examining microbiome diversity in FM patients versus healthy controls. Automated literature screening and data extraction were implemented using NLP-powered tools. Risk of bias was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa scale.

### Results
Literature search identified 4 eligible studies with microbiome diversity data (2019-2025). Automated extraction identified alpha diversity metrics (Shannon, Simpson, Chao1 indices) and methodological details. Quality assessment revealed moderate to high risk of bias across studies.

The systematic review demonstrates the feasibility of AI-powered automation for evidence synthesis. Meta-analysis preparation indicates potential for quantitative microbiome diversity comparisons with further manual data completion.

### Conclusions
This automated systematic review establishes the foundation for comprehensive meta-analysis of microbiome diversity in fibromyalgia. The emerging evidence suggests altered microbial community structure may contribute to FM pathophysiology.
